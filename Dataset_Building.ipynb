Occasionally a power tool for a short period of time.\\nMost shops with extensive use of high demanding electrical tools including high capacity welders will nevertheless have a simple 120V or 240V single phase service contract.\\nLots of, if not most, electricians will install a 50A main breaker nonetheless knowing that that\\'s what a #8Cu THW and a #6Al can carry.\\nSo there\\'s quite a few things that don\\'t add up here and it makes one wonder about the quality of the provided service. The disconnect means requirement of 30A is way lower than what the wiring instructions would be capable of (50A) for a pure 120V service and very boldly limits the end users consumption.\\nThe fact that the instructions for a 240V service are not altered in any way other than requiring an additional wire and a different meter base is just outrageous and makes it per their own definition completely useless unless you want to permanently trip the main service interrupt with your 240V appliances.\\nIt appears that the only power providing utility in the country does not necessarily adhere to the nationally published electrical code or even less promote it. (In fact in reality most of their personell wouldn\\'t even know a code existed and any educated layman would cringe over many of the installations done by the utility)\\n',\n",

Siemens schematic\\nMy question is this: Can I leave the existing 225A main shutoff at the subfeed panel even though the max current for the upstream feed is 200A?\\nBasically, I bought the panel that has larger capacity and it came with a larger main (225A); however, the circuits in use are spec'd for 200A and that's why the upstream (from the meter/panel main) is 200A.\\nMy thought is, just as with everything else, the smallest number will win, but the 225A physical shutoff (while not even strictly necessary because there's a physical upstream shutoff) provides an easier way to kill the power locally vs going outside.\\nAnything wrong with my logic/plan?\\nThanks!\\n\",\n",

We shipped a US dryer here and are trying to figure out how to wire it properly (me and local electricians). From my research dryers use 240 V only for the heater and motor. The panel components just use 120 V. They need two live wires to combine and make 240V for the heater and motor.  Dryers here are EXTREMELY expensive, and hard to come by so we are trying to make this work to make the wife happy.\\nThe house we are in is wired so that it has the US 120 V. and the 240 V outlets. They have a big transformer by the breaker box doing the step down from 240 to 120 for all the 120 V outlets in the house.\\nThe current idea is to separate the 240 V. components from the 120 V. components. So have two plugs coming from it. One that connects to the 240 V plug to power the heater and motor. The other plug to come and plug into the 120 V. outlet.\\nAfter looking at the wiring inside it looks like one live wire stays up top to power the control panel. While the other life wire along with the ground goes below to connect at a junction on the motor to power that and the heater. I also notice a neutral white wire going from the electrical control panel up top, goes down to the bottom and meets at that same junction. I imagine to give down below the extra 120 V. to become 240V?\\nSo finally the question. Can I just get rid of that neutral wire to separate the two systems and wire them to two separate plugs???\\nHere is the electrical schematic that was inside the dryer. Not sure how to read it but hopefully it helps.\\n\\n',\n",

I used an Etekcity MSR-R500 and had it set to the AC 500 setting and measured the following:\\nBased on my research it would seem that Y to X should have read 240 V, not 0.

Occasionally I want to run that arc welder in my basement. My thought is to cut the existing circuit in the basement and install a similar l14-30 outlet. And then put a junction box  on the remaining wire that goes to the garage with a flexible wire l14-30 plug.\\nBasically the wire to the garage then looks like an extension cord. Normally that \"extension cord\" is plugged into the new outlet and the garage is constantly energized. When I want to use the welder in the basement I unplug the \"extension cord\" and plug in the welder.\\nThere may be other ways to do this, but I have some other uses for that \"extension cord\" and I don\\'t want to complicate this note with those details.\\nIs this configuration allowed by code?\\nThanks, Frank\\n',\n",

It will feed into a VFD (assuming already sized for the application) which will provide 240v three phase.\\nThe second circuit again having a NEMA L14-30P plug will utilize only 1 hot wire, a ground, and neutral leaving the 2nd hot wire not connected.

How come? If the L-shaped blade is connected to ground, shouldn't I read 240 V between it and one of the diagonal blades, and 0 V between it and the other blade?\\nOr are the diagonal blades in opposite phase with each other, each carrying 120 V relative to ground, and therefore 240 V relative to each other?\\nI'm asking because I need 240 V for a small Everlast PowerTig 200DX welder - it could be connected either to 110 V from a regular AC socket (through a short passive adapter) or to 240 V. But the 240 V plug on the welder is not 10-30 but 6-50:\\n\\nI've found a 10-30 to 6-50 adapter but I need to make sure I won't fry the welder if the wiring is wrong.\\nThe welder can sense whether it's being fed 240 or 110 V and switch automatically (the 110 to 240 adapter that came with it is passive, just a short cable with specific connectors on each end).\\nEDIT: I should add that the machine, according to the manual, draws less than 30 A continuously even at 100% output settings.

It had 30A outer pair for the dryer and 20A inner pair for my well pump.  Both pairs were tied together so you could turn them on or off together - the mechanism tying them together was identical to the ones used on these Eaton's  BQ220230 and BQC220230\\nAfter doing a ton of reading online I still have 3 specific questions:\\n1) I've read that these handles are for convenience (so you can turn them both on or off at the same time), and that they do NOT make the breaker in to a common trip breaker (i.e. even with the handles you can still have one side of a pair trip without causing the other to trip).  I did see a thread here though, indicating that someone should add these handles to create a common trip.  Is this correct?  The handles tying each pair together do, or do not create a common trip?\\n2)  The breaker I'm replacing was labeled independent trip, and I see common trip models are available (the BQC varient mentioned above).  Why wouldn't I want common trip?  The failure I had was only one of the dryer breakers tripping (this was sort of ok because the dryer would work, it just wouldn't get hot).  If this happened to my pump circuit though, wouldn't running it at 120v damage it?  Is there any reason I don't understand that would make me want to use independent trip instead of common trip?\\n3) Last, I just wanted to confirm that for the BQC common trip mentioned above. The 'common' only applies to the other side of the same pair, and not to the other pair.  I.e. if the top trips (dryer) it will also trip the bottom (dryer), but not trip the two centers (pump).\\n\",\n",

Voltage across the hot terminals is 247 and, of course, approximately 124 volts from each hot terminal to neutral.  So far, so good.  However, on both outlets, the voltage across the metal face plate to either of the hot terminals is 14-18 volts.  Why the heck is that?  There is a bare ground wire in each of the boxes, but there is no ground terminal on the 10-30R receptacle, so the ground wires are just pushed to the back of the boxes.

The ground wire was located behind the box, in the wall. It\\'s a bit short (??) but it will do once I put the subpanel in. Thanks for everyone who responded.\\nI am tracing the somewhat old wiring network in my house... and I found one blind box on the patio (outside), with 3 8AWG wires inside, two hot and one neutral, that is connected, via a 50-60\\' wall run, to my main panel and a pair of 60AMP breakers.\\nI am guessing that was for an AC, since that would justify using 8AWG wire on such large breakers. Now, I don\\'t have an AC there, or a need for it, but I could use a couple of patio outlets.\\nI was first thinking about putting a small sub-panel there, to have some space for future expansion, but digging into the wall is out of question, so I cannot put the 4th wire (ground) in to make it code-legal.\\nSo, in fact, with 3 wires only I seem to be limited to doing a 120V setup? Can I just install a smaller single breaker at the main panel, say 20A, and then use the 3 existing wires as hot/neutral/ground (re-wiring them at the panel, obviously). Do I need to mark them, e.g. \"turn red into green\"? Or is there a more interesting way to use the existing wiring? What would you do?  ;)\\n',\n",

Now I want to add an AC unit which they tell me will require 30amps. Now based on some load calculation table that the city permit folks want me to fill it seems I will go over the 125amps. They give you demand-factor reduction, take into account that you will not use AC and floor heating at same time etc - but taking all that into account and I still go over 125 amps by a little - the total is 135amps.\\nOne solution is to use a DPDT switch that switches between  either my EV car charger or my AC.

Alternatively I can use a  generator interlock to solve my problem  - I don't fully get how that works and would need some guidance.\\nWould either of the above two solutions pass code? Can EV charging 24v outlet into which I plug my car  go through a DPDT switch?

I cannot change it.  It has a black wire, a red wire and a ground wire.  It looks like this:\\n\\nWe plan to use it in an old cabin that was built in the 1940's.  There is an existing 240V 3 prong 50A outlet in the kitchen.  Upon opening the outlet, I found a red wire, white wire and black wire in what looks to be 6 gauge?  It's very thick, and hard to bend.  There is no ground wire present.\\n\\nMy understanding was that I could just wire in the black and red on the range top, and not use the neutral wire in the outlet box.  But the fact that there is no ground in the outlet box means I can't ground the range top.\\nWhat is the proper way to wire this up without having to run an entirely new outlet from the breaker panel?\\nUPDATE: Added picture of breaker panel wiring, and it appears the metal box is indeed grounded?\\n@ThreePhaseEel, yes I plan to hard wire it. I'm away at the moment, but can take a photo later. There is a 3/4 inch metal conduit entering the top of the outlet box. You can see it in the 3rd photo.\\nUpdate 2: Okay, you guys are going to freak, but here is a photo of what I'm dealing with here.  This is all the panels for the cabin:\\nNow, I consider myself to be very handy.  I do all my own mechanical and electrical work on my cars, I run my own outdoor gas lines, run my own electrical for my landscaping, etc.  Add outlets within the house... But I'm obviously not an electrician.  It seems like it would be easy enough to replace that sub-panel myself, but in light of all the other panels on that wall, is this looking like something that I should have an electrician handle?\\nUpdate 3 My original question has been answered, but it opened another can of worms.  And so I've created a new question to address the panel replacement/rewiring: Proper way to modernize 1940's cabin sub-panels\\nThank you all so much for your very generous help!  It is greatly appreciated.\\n\",\n",

The existing range is natural gas powered so it doesn't have a dedicated circuit (It's just plugged into a 15 or 20amp outlet). Other existing wiring includes a dedicated microwave circuit (15amp breaker but need to check wire gauge). This one I suppose can be used for the fridge (since the fridge currently doesn't seem to have a dedicated breaker).\\nThe oven/microwave combination model I am looking at is KitchenAid KOCE500EBS (KOCE500E model, the BS is just a color code) or similar. The installation manual has these electrical requirements.\\nMy breaker box has a 200A main breaker but I am basically out of room. There is a sub-panel wired right next to it (with a 40A double breaker) that I added for laundry and it has room for 4 single breakers.\\nWhat options do I have here? I'm thinking the best approach would be to offload a couple of 15amp circuits marked with red rectangle on the photo (provided I have enough slack - which I should for those bottom breakers) and wire them into a sub-panel. This would free up 2 neighboring boxes in the main panel for a double 40A breaker. Is this a good solution? If I cannot relocate those two 15amp breakers, can I wire for the oven from the sub-panel or do I need to beef up the sub-panel circuit (and by how much), since it already has washer/dryer? Should I be using an 8 AWG or 6 AWG wire to cover me for any future upgrades (say double oven)?\\nThanks so much! Dave\\nThe photos of the panels are shown below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Namely, I'm trying to put a 240V outlet with no neutral pathway on the same circuit as a lightswitch, if possible. I've drafted up the following incomplete wiring diagram for reference:\\nSome specific questions:\\nI'm using 2-wire flexible metal conduit. So when I wire up the two hots to the dual-pole breaker to power up the 240V socket, which has no neutral pathway, these wires are left floating in the wind. What am I supposed to do with them?\\nIdeally, I would like to power the shop lights on the same circuit as the 240V outlet. Can I use one of the hots coming off of the dual-pole breaker to power the lights? Maybe I can use those two neutrals here as well?\\nFor obvious reasons, I'm under the assumption that I'm supposed to be getting 240V across the two poles of the 240V outlet. However, my application of Kirchhoff's laws to the circuit gives me 0V across the poles. Can someone explain to me what I'm missing?\\nI'm happy to clarify anything I've said.Thanks for the help!\\nHope I'm interpreting correctly.\\n\",\n",

(The Mysa thermostat.) Picture of the existing thermostats below.\\n\\nI did some research. I watched YouTube videos on 240V. I read the heater wiring diagrams. I read (twice) the Mysa install documentation. I pulled off the first thermostat on that circuit and it was exactly what I expected. 2 wires coming in from the breaker (red and black) and 2 wires going to the heater. I followed the instructions, triple-checked my work, put the new thermostat on the wall, and threw the breaker back on. Ta da! Smart thermostat bliss!\\nBreaker back off. Removed the other thermostat. WTF???!!!  There were only 2 wires in the box. One was connected to a red. The other was connected to a corresponding black. The other red and black were not connected and had wire nuts capping them off.\\nThe heater works, but based on my (VERY LIMITED) understanding of 240V, I have no clue what is going on here. Or even how this is supposed to be working. The heater is definitely a 240V heater. Is there something sneaky / sketchy going on inside the wall that I can't see?\\nI'd appreciate it if anyone has suggestions.\\n\",\n",

I opened the mobile home\\'s 200 amp breaker box at the pole. It has a double breaker for both hot legs, 90 amp double breaker for the heat pump package unit. It also has the 20 amp pump double breaker.\\nThe pump uses 12-2 cable with ground. I added a 20 amp double breaker with 12-3 with a ground uf cable in conduit out to two sheds. One 110v leg to one shed and the other to the shed beside it. There was no neutral white wires except the one from the new uf cable.\\nThe neutral from the pole is bonded to the bus bars on either side. My white neutral to the sheds is the only one there. There in no ground rod for the box but the ground wire is going into the meter box. The connector between the meter and the breaker box is pvc so I\\'m not sure if the neutral is electrically bonded to the power pole neutral to the meter case.\\nAs for the double wide there must be a ground/ground rod for the 200 amp interior breaker box. As for the transformer I found these two on ebay:  one, two\\nThanks for all that. Looks like it might be less hassle/expense to just put the gfi at the front corner of the house which is about 30 ft from the pump house. Yes is is a structure that I can stand up in as I wanted to store some yard tools in it. I guess it is easier to just add a light. Here is what\\'s out there. First there is a waterproof box with the 12-2 with ground from the breaker box, and 12-2 with the ground going to the pressure switch.They are seperated by a double pole switch to disconnect the pump to work on it. The bare ground wire is attached to the metal box ground lug and a ground lug in the pressure switch with the ground coming up from the pump. I added a waterproof box for the switch above (rather than smash it all in tha single box) and the gfi. That box has a tap in the rear to receive the x-former out for the gfi/light. The boxes are connected by a metal nipple but no actual green wire from ground lugs in each box. Out the top of that box using the \"load\" connections goes a green, white and black through conduit to an octagon box at the ceiling with a porcelin lamp holder that has an outlet and pull switch. I replaced the old douple pole switch with a new 30 amp one. Ok, so switching to just a light in there I have an extra porcelin single lamp holder for two bulbs in series. I can easily change things around as I have extra electrical parts. If I can get a 220 v lamp with a regular base, do I use the bare wire connected to that green ground going the the light for ID purposes or the white ?\\n',\n",

I believe the wire is 4 gauge; the charging unit plugs in rather then being directly hard wired. The unit is on a 50 amp breaker.

I could imagine tying into the existing 240 volt plug with another charging unit side-by-side. If this were 120 v lamps it seems that it would be easy to set up another plug in parallel.\\nClearly I'm not an electrician but I would like to think this through before I bring a professional into the project.

Our old oven is gas, so I need to run a new 240 circuit.  The oven draws 20A.\\nI am currently at a loss regarding how to attach the pigtail connection that came with the oven to the 240 V wiring that I am going to run to the breaker box.  I initially presumed that I need a junction box, and I\\'m not sure if the twist-on style are appropriate for these current levels.  Additionally, I understand that there is an NEC requirement to be able to disconnect the oven from power locally (i.e. via unplugging it, or turning off a switch).\\nIs wiring up a 240 V junction box for this situation any different than a 120 V circuit?\\nHome Depot has been no help.  Initially they told me to purchase four of these, connect like colors inside a junction box, and then just \"wrap them up like hell with electrical tape\".  This sounded rather dangerous to me, so I came back during another shift to ask someone else.  This time they said that my oven should have arrived with a plug (not a pigtail), and that I have to install a 240 V outlet to plug the oven into.  I then also have to replace the pigtail with a corded plug by opening the oven, removing the pigtail from its attachment points (which they presumed were screw ring terminals) and install the corded plug by replacing like colors.  Unfortunately, when I opened the oven, I found that the pigtail feeds into a wiring harness that runs to multiple places in the oven and there are no screw terminals in sight.\\nSo I\\'m at a loss of what to do next.  Surely there must be a way to install the oven without re-engineering it.\\n\\n',\n",

I checked all the fuses with my multi meter and everything seems to be working.  Before I rewired a slot in my circuit breaker box for 240 volt slot I had to run my dryer on a 120 slot.  It worked and it would dry the clothes but take a lot longer to dry.   I rewired and installed a 240 volt plug right next to my 120 volt.  Now that I have my 240 volt plug no heat goes to the dryer. I checked and each side of the 3 slot outlet has 120 volts.  The plug going to my dryer also shows each side of the plug has `120 going to the dryer.  I also tried it with another wire and another outlet to see if that was the issue of why the 240 wasn't working.

When I did the the two screws next to factory installed it gave me nothing but when I did one screw at a time with the top neutral line coming in I got 120 Volts on each one.  Does that mean I am only getting 120 volts to the box?  I also noticed this on my meter that it says 120V 2W.  I wasn't sure if that meant 120 for each wire or the 2 wires equal 120V\\n\",\n",

Am I able to make an adapter for the NEMA power cord (15A) that will split the 3 wires into two 120v plugs? For one plug, I will run a hot and a neutral and the other plug just the hot. This will give me 2 hots, one from each side of the breaker box, and a single neutral.\\nI know this isn't ideal, and ideally you would have a single breaker that would trip, killing both legs. But, if it did pull too much current from one leg, that would trip the overloaded breaker.\\nPlease tell me how crazy I am.\\n\\n\",\n",

My plan is to run conduit from the panel to the attic then bury the wire via conduit on the opposite side to enter the shed.\\nNot realizing how unruly 8/3 UF-B wire is to work with I purchased a long enough section for the entire run knowing this wire meets code for the use in exterior conduit.  I quickly realized it is all but impossible to pull this through 1 1/4\" Sch 40 conduit.\\nIn this process, I have also noted what I believe are exisiting code deficiencies I am afraid they will be caught when my new electrical install is inspected.\\nAny input in regards to the following questions would be greatly appreciated!\\n1) My main service panel has several 14/2 romex wires exiting the panel into exterior conduit into the attic. This was done before I purchased the house, as I understand this is not up to code as romex is not rated for any type of outdoor use.  Should I expect my electrical inspector to also check my main panel in order to certify my subpanel, and will I be required to mediate these deficiencies?\\n2a) Would best practice be to use the UF-B to cross the attic and use junction boxes on either end to transition to THWN prior to entering the conduit? 2b) Could I make multiple connections (8/3, 12/3, 10/2 to corresponding THWN) within a single junction box, what is the best way to calculate the necessary volume? Would this be an appropriate option Link\\n2c) Can I use a single common ground through the conduit to the subpanel\\n3) In the attic, which is not considered to be a liveable space can I run the wire over the insulation or does it need to be affixed to the rafters?\\nEDIT:  I have now adjusted my plan to only use the UF-B cable to traverse the attic.

My laundry room has an existing NEMA 10-30 outlet that is not being used since we have a gas dryer. I am thinking about getting an electric car so I'll need a place to charge it in the garage which is located just outside the laundry room door which is just adjacent to this unused 10-30 outlet. My thought was maybe I could junction off of this outlet and run a 10 gauge Romex to the garage wall for a new outlet to plug in the car.\\nI was hoping to not have to run all new cable from the breaker box because that is in the basement. The breaker for this circuit a 2-pole 30 amp breaker. Since I may some day want to use this laundry room outlet if we were to get an electric dryer, I was thinking it would be nice to keep that installed as an outlet and just run new wires from that to the garage. I wasn't sure if that was acceptable and if I did this would it mean that I'd only be able to use one outlet at a time. The car can be set to pull 24 amps for the 30 amp circuit. (80% of 30 amps) As I said I don't need the outlet now but if some day I wanted to use it would this be a problem for the circuit?\\nMy other thought is to just move the NEMA 10-30 outlet (or install a new NEMA 14-30) to the garage and use the existing outlet box as a junction box to tie-in the new cables. Then close the laundry room box up with a blank faceplate so it won't be usable anymore. I would then use the newly installed garage outlet for the car charging.\\nI appreciate any advice you can offer for this situation. I've relocated 120 volt outlets before for various reasons but I've never done this for a 240 so I wasn't sure if that makes a difference. I'll likely get an electrician to do the work either way but just thought I'd get some advice here on what is possible.\\nThanks for the responses this has been helpful. I was not aware that the code requires EV chargers to be on a dedicated circuit so that was good to learn. Here's a few pictures I was finally able to take of the outlet wiring. I'll probably just get an electrician to add a dedicated 50 amp circuit to the garage instead and leave this one as is.\\n\\n\",\n",

But I recently am having a problem with a job that I know I have had many years ago but I just can't remember what solution I came to back then.\\nBasically what's happening is I have a swim spa that is run off of 240V 4-wire system. Some of the components run off the circuit board are not working, so I tested the power at the circuit. I get 120V between both Hots and neutral. I also get 120V between both hots and ground.  But when I test both hots together, I do not get 240V as I should! Instead I get around 40 volts. I also tested this with the circuit board completely disconnected from the power so that it was not under a load, and I got all of the same readings except when I tested between the two hots, rather then get 240V I got .44V.\\n(editor's note: Google Voice Keyboard does not insert decimal points easily, so I am treating it as bona-fide.)\\nThe strange part is that I went to the 50A sub-panel that feeds the circuit board, and I tested 240V going into and out from a 50 amp breaker. As far as I can tell there is nothing else between the sub panel in the circuit board.\\nThis job is really out of the way and hard for me to schedule in this time of year.  I did have them call an electrician, but it seems that the electrician only looked at another part of the system that is completely unrelated, and they are having trouble getting him back out there or finding someone else to look at the system. So I thought I would ask for your guy's help as I know I ran into this issue many years ago and I just can't remember what the solution was.\\nWe also called an electrician that works with us a little bit, but no useful information out of him; other than the 50A  breaker in the sub panel could be bad, which didn't make a lot of sense to me since we are getting good power coming out of it. Unfortunately when I was there I never checked neutral to ground. If anyone out there can refresh my memory or offer any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it, as they are really trying to get this resolved as soon as possible for 4th of July.\\nUPDATE\\nI appreciate you guys taking the time to get back to me and I apologize as I was clearly using speech to text crappy technology but I am multitasking as much as possible as we are in the final crunch for the 4th of July right now. After I submitted this question I think I found my own answer but just to reply to some things that were asked here...\\nThese were my readings going into the TB1 at the circuit board:\\n@ board (while connected) White-black 122v White-red 116v Green-black 120v (not exactly,  but within acceptable range) Green-red 120v (not exactly,  but within acceptable range) Black-red 44v\\n@ board (disconnected)\\nWhite-black 122v White-red 116v Green-black 120v (not exactly,  but within acceptable range) Green-red 120v (not exactly,  but within acceptable range)lack-red Black-red.25v ( in my original post I wrote .44 but I was misremembering)\\n@ sub panel Black-red IN 244 Black-red OUT 244\\nYes the breaker in the sub panel is the one that feeds this system and no it is not to single pole Breakers but one double pole breaker, but what I found out by reading through a tech manual for this system is that the power does come out of that sub panel and go somewhere else before going over to the circuit board where I was having the problem. I had thought that both of these systems were independent of each other and I think that is where the problem was. This is an endless pool swim spa which has both a hydraulic swim jet system and also an electric heat system. Because I've never worked on one of these before I had assumed that they were independent of each other because that's how things looked at first glance. Most of the problem is just that we are overworked just do not have enough time to do everything we need so I didn't spend the time on and I would have liked to have spent. Still though I feel like I ran into this situation in my past and any other hot tubs that I've ever worked on would not have had something else between the sub panel and the hot tub. My assumption at this point is that I am also wrong about that and misremembering something I worked on in the past based on what you guys are saying.\\nIf I am still wrong about where this is heading I will post back with my findings the next time I get out there but at this point it's nothing that I am going to fix anyways as I am not a licensed electrician and the problem seems to be and electrical whip between the main control box that is mounted to the hydraulic pump and the circuit board in the spa pack. Especially considering this endless pool since inside the house in their basement. Either way, like I said I appreciate your time and I'm sorry for all of the errors in my post. I will report back its problems on my end persist.\\n\",\n",

Hardly any show their wiring diagrams, so if they don't give more details, I don't know if they'll work.

(Lets say for ease of example that this is the only breaker in the main panel, aka nothing else is using electricity in the main panel.)\\nI run 6 gauge feeder wires (two hots, one neutral) from this 60amp double-pole breaker to a smaller 60amp panel, a few feet away.\\nThis sub-panel has a 60amp main breaker.\\nNow I install four 20amp single pole breakers, all in line, so two on each leg.\\nNow lets say I install four total 20amp single outlet receptacles, 1 outlet per circuit (using 12 gauge wire).\\nI have four theoretical high powered devices and i plug one into each outlet and turn it on.  Each device continuously draws about 1,920 watts.  So in total i am drawing about 7,680 watts (four x 1,920 watts).\\nThe 60amp sub-panel can handle this because it is less than 14,400 watts (60amp x 240v).  Is this the correct way to calculate this?\\nNow lets say i double up and install eight 20amp single pole breakers, and eight total 20amp single outlet receptacles, one on each circuit -- but now i also have eight total high-powered devices, and i plug one into each receptacles and turn them all on.\\nEach devices continuously draws about 1,920 watts.  So in total i am drawing about 15,360 watts (eight x 1,920 watts).\\nThis would trip the breaker in the sub panel, because it is over the 14,400 watts (60amp x 240v) it can handle, correct?\\nIf this is all correct, then I am wondering this:\\nPart 2:\\nIn the first example, I installed four 20amp single-pole breakers, two on each leg.  But what if i install them all on one leg -- for instance, I leave a space between each breaker I install.\\nNow I run the same experiment -- one 20amp outlet on each circuit, four devices total, each plugged into one outlet.  Each device draws 1,920 watts, for a total of 7,680 watts (four x 1,920 watts).\\nWould the 60amp breaker still be fine, or would it trip because all the circuits, and therefore devices, are on one leg?\\nEssentially I'm asking, would i still calculate the amount the breaker can handle by multiplying 60amp by 240v, or would i now have to multiply 60amp by 120v, which would only be 7,200 watts (less than the 7,680 watts my devices are drawing).\\nThank you so much for your time!\\n\",\n",

I will also omit any reference to ground wires for clarity.  I am in north america and have two 120v hots and one neutral coming into my panel.\\nThank you for any help!\\nPART 1:\\nI want to see if i properly understand how to wire 2-Pole Quad Circuit Breakers. Here is an example pic:\\n\\nTo wire this breaker, I would run three cables, lets say romex.  two of the three  would be identical - they would be 14/2 (14 gauge wire, with one hot, one neutral).\\nOne cable of romex will go to the top 15amp breaker, and one to the bottom 15 amp breaker -- I Would attach the hot wire to the top screw, and bring the neutral to the neutral bus, and repeat the same process for the bottom, with its own hot and neutral from the second strand of romex.  These 2 now function like independent 120v, 15 amp circuit breakers.\\nNext, the third strand of romex.  It would need to be at least 10gauge wire because the center breaker is 30 amp.  It would also need to be 3 wire romex with two hots, and one neutral.\\nI would attach the two hots to the two center screws, and the neutral to the neutral bus.  Now it functions like a 240v, 30 amp double pole breaker.\\nDoes part 1 all look correct?  If so, here are my next questions for part 2 and 3:\\nPart 2:\\nFocusing only on the 30 amp, 240v middle part: I run the 10gauge romex to a box and i install a 30 amp 240v outlet, that has 3 slots including ground slot. i would connect the two hots, and ground.\\n(I just cap the neutral off with a wire nut and leave it for future expansion of more outlets down the line, or if i want to change to a four prong outlet that needs a neutral, correct?)\\nThis outlet can now supply a device with 7,200 watts (240v x 30amps), or for safety, 80% of 7,200 watts, which is 5,760 watts.\\nWhat if instead of installing the 30amp outlet, i want to install 2 receptacles, lets say they are both 20 amp duplex outlets.\\nTo wire them, I connect one hot wire to the gold screw of the first outlet, and the other hot to the gold screw of the second outlet.  I pigtail the neutral wire, and connect 1 pigtail each to the silver screw of outlet 1 and 2.\\n\\nI believe this would be called a multi-wire branch circuit (mwbc)?\\nEach receptacle can safely handle 1,920 watts of power draw, which is 80% of 120v x 20amps.  So if i have two devices that both draw about 1,900 watts of continuous power, i could plug one into one receptacle, and one into the other receptacle, and they could both safely run without tripping the breaker, or overheating, is this all correct?\\nOk, so if everything is correct so far, here is my final question:\\nPart 3\\nLets say instead of the first quad breaker show, i buy this one:\\n\\nNow the two outer 15amp breakers are tied together, and i assume they internally trip together.  So lets say instead of running the two separate 14/2 romex cables to these two 15 amp breakers, i now run just one 14/3 romex, and i connect one hot to the top, and one hot to the bottom, and neutral to bus.\\nI could now have a mwbc like the example above, except with 15 amp outlets, and each receptacle would only safely supply 1,440 watts (80% x 120v x 15amps).\\nIm guessing I could also then wire a single 15amp outlet rated for 240v, in a similar method to the wiring of the 30amp outlet described above?  I dont think there is any reason to do that in america, because no devices require that, or have a plug that would fit, but im just curious.\\nIs this all okay to do, since they will now trip together, and must be shut off together?\\nThank you so much for your time!\\n',\n",

Specifics of my situation:\\nMax charging current will be 32A, so I need #8 wire.\\nBreaker box is on an exterior wall, at a wire length of 90-100 ft from the outlet.\\nI\\'m proposing to run the first 70\\' through the attic; then pop out for the last 20\\' or so. I had originally thought I\\'d just run 8/3 NM Romex all the way, but found out to my dismay that Romex cannot be used in outdoor conduit. Then I figured I might strip away the sheath and treat it as THHN outside, but one of the answers to the linked question made short shrift of that idea.\\nSo now I am faced with the following restrictions:\\nSo my current thinking is to run Romex to near the exit point, and hop over to THHN/UF in a junction box before exiting the wall to the exterior of the house. The remainder to the breaker box will run in conduit outdoor. However, it will need connecting the two different conductor types with wire nuts. I am wary about doing this on thick wires, for a circuit that will have a constant 32A draw.\\nMy questions are:\\nAlso a comment/question about pricing: #8 THHN is $0.64/ft at the local home improvement store. So $64 per 100ft for one wire! $256 for 100 ft for 4 wires. I thought THHN was supposed to be cheap; how/why is it so much more expensive than Romex, which one would think has the same amount of copper? For comparison, a 125\\' 8/3 Romex reel is $185.\\nEDIT: Adding a further restriction on my setup to address @Harper\\'s suggestion of using thicker wire. If I am to use the only side (bottom-left) knockout available on the breaker box, I need to do a tight 3\" radius turn into the breaker owing to obstruction from a fiber box mounted infuriatingly close. I have seen that only 1/2\" LiquidTight metallic conduit is able to do that, and four #8 wires already is technically past the fill for that size (but thinking pushing the rules a little might be ok for the last 6\" of the run?). The only alternative is drilling a hole on the top-right side of the breaker box, but I fear I might be biting off more than I can chew at that point. Space inside the box is also quite constrained, so stuffing thick wire inside and running it to my circuit breaker will be a minor challenge as it is. These breaker box constraints are why I dropped down from #6 to #8 in the first place. :-/ (Of course, found luckily that #8 is electrically sufficient for my projected need).\\n',\n",

Receptable location to avoid damage to cord.\\nIt then ends with:\\nAll other electric vehicle supply equipment shall be permanently wired and fastened in place to the supporting surface, a wall, a pole, or other structure.

I checked the breaker - looked good. I measured the voltage at the hot water tank; it read ~15Vac. I checked the double breaker for the hot water tank and it also measured ~15Vac. One step further, the line-to-line voltage coming into the main breaker read ~15Vac. Both 120Vac L-N branches give a voltage but one is at ~118Vac (good) and the other is around ~105Vac (hence my ~15Vac differential, it appears on the surface). When I open the main breaker, both L-N at the main breaker primary read ~120Vac. The hot water tank is the only 208/220 circuit in the house (and the only double breaker). Any idea what could be causing this suddenly? It looked to me like both branches were being fed, in phase, and that is why the difference between them is literally the difference between them. I had read that an open circuit on one of the main lines could cause this (the open line being backfed by the good line through the double breaker). But I'm not sure why the hot water tank would have worked up until this point.\\n\",\n",

Had to change over the three prong 220v plug in with a 220v twist plug.  Been over a year since using backup power.  Plugged in the 220 to generator then to GenTran.  Went to basement to manually switch from line to gen - but the switch appears to be totally dead.  Ignores off position - all power just stays on.  Checked the generator to be sure it was outputting power and it was.  Wouldn't really matter since off should be off(?).\\nAll breakers are okay - none popped.  Not sure where to look for troubleshooting this.  Occurs to me that when I looked at old connector, I wrote down what wire the electrician attached where....I thought I was mistaken on my notes, but he had the white/green backwards (?) on the twist lock side (?) or am I wrong.  I did check the receptacle attached to the house to be sure the white (neutral) was where it should be and green (ground) was where it should be and all was okay,figured I just wrote it down wrong. Weird too, that he also cut the white wire on the 220 plug and used the green as common.  Am I not understanding something?  I have a feeling I fried the switch....or popped some internal breaker or ?\\nThinking about why this worked now after correctly hooking up connections, I wonder how it ever worked to begin with since it looks like 240V was over 2-wires all the way to the switch where I guess, it was somehow stripped down to 120V?  Not sure how.  Now I am using two 120 circuits over 3 wires then only combined to 240 for well pump.  I have no idea how this could have worked with previous wiring......though it has been working for 23 years.  All seems to be good now with the exception of voltage meters on the switch. That might have something to do with old vs new wiring scheme.\\nO\\n\",\n",

That is, based on the physical dimensions and prong arrangement compared to info I found online, I believe this is a NEMA #6-15R receptacle. Am I right?\\nIf the rest of the circuit is 40A but the outlet 15A, then I think this would be undersized and dangerous? Would it be appropriate to replace this #6-15R with a #6-30R? Do I also need to put in a 30A breaker?\\nThe reason this came up is that I would like to use a 20A 240V heater in the garage. The heater uses a #6-30P plug, which can be seen dangling in one of the photos below.

Possible also to use the existing 120V GFCI receptacles and regular single pole breakers fed off this panel too, in this situation.\\nOr could leave the current two GFCI receptacles alone and take 12g wire pig-tailed from the ends of the MWBC to a 'spa' panel, change out the breaker in the 'spa' panel for a 15A or 20A 220V double pole GFCI breaker and then connect a 220V receptacle.\\nOr I could attach an inline 220V GFCI to the hot leads of the MWBC in a junction box.\\nOr I could use a 2000W step up/down transformer plugged into one of the 120V GFCI receptacles.

However, in addition to the cord having two hots and ground, there's a small blue cable that I'm not sure what it's hooked up for. Is it for the circuit breaker (leakage current sensor, or LCDI; it's similar to a GFCI receptacle with the test & reset buttons but apparently for a different use) built into the plug, and if so can I bypass it? And if not, what is it for, and how do I account for it on the new plug, which just takes hot, neutral, and ground? I realize the risks of just bypassing it, but I'm desperate.\\nThe air conditioner probably around 15 years old, give or take. At least 13 years. It's a Whirlpool, the model is ACQ244XR2.\\nThe longer story, I'm hoping this will fix the air conditioner. It simply does not turn on anymore; there's no display, and the controls don't work (it's all digital). The test/reset breaker on the plug actually still seems to work okay, but of course, there's no power. I've tested the plug with a multimeter and everything tests okay (there's the occasional jump to 1000 when I wiggle the lead connected to a hot but I'm assuming that's user error or from it being a cheap multimeter). All in all, I can't afford to replace it or hire an electrician so I'm hoping this is the only issue. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.\\n\",\n",

On the outside of our home there is a standard electrical box (guessing about 3\"x5\") to install an outlet. There is no outlet yet but just a cover and inside the box is a 4-wire (3 conductor + ground) 12AWG cable with red, black, white and bare conductors. It was meant to be used for an outside kitchen appliance but then stayed unused. However, I have a need for a 120V (GFCI?) outlet at that position and need to pull 120V to an outside counter top. The pipe from that outlet to the counter top is already in place. All of this is shown in the image below. The electrical box with the yellow wire (3 conductors + ground) and then the pipe with the gray wire that will go into the box.\\nOn the breaker box there is a double 20A breaker. See the second image below.\\nSo the idea is to do a MWBC. I would connect:\\nSince the black and red are on different phases I should be able to pull 20V from each without burning up my neutral. Does that plan sound correct and is that up to code?\\nAn alternative I guess would be to replace the double breaker with a single breaker (see bottom image. I guess I could use 20A but going lower doesn\\'t do any harm) and a cover. Then I only have 120V on either the red or black with the other not being connected to anything. The biggest issue I have with this is that it seems I have to take the wire from the current breaker and connect it to the new breaker but I believe there isn\\'t a way to kill power on that wire because it\\'s in the main panel and not a sub panel. Or does the quadruple 200A switch kill power to all the other breakers in the main panel? In any case, the MWBC is preferred if it\\'s up to code.\\n[4\\nEdit: Based on comments I added a drawing if making the change in the service anel. Please see the hand-drawing at the bottom. This is not really want I want to do, i.e. preferably I like to keep the service panel unchanged and just create two 120V outlets from the 240V outlet.\\n',\n",

I took the unit down to inspect the fan motor and took it to an electrical service person to see if it could be mended, or if not to hopefully source a replacement. The techie pronounced the motor dead and confirmed my fears that replacement parts are not available from the manufacturer, one typically has to replace the whole 3-in-1 unit.\\nI despise the disposable mindset of modern consumer appliances so I went looking for another solution. I found A/C fridge evaporator fan motors were widely available and one 'universal' motor from an online retailer that remarkably had the same dimensions for the mounting posts and similar appearance to my busted one (albeit much lighter), so I thought I would try that.\\nOriginal dead motor:\\nMy adapted replacement:\\nThe following specs are provided for the new motor:\\n240Volts AC, 10Watt, 50/60Hz.    Shaft length 30mm, shaft diameter 3.17mm,   total depth 90mm from tip of shaft to back of mounting knob.\\nHere are the terminals on the 3-in-1 unit (plastic fan shroud with lamp sockets) with the fan removed. The original motor had two writes running into the right-hand-side of the Fan and Neutral terminals.\\n\\nSo I successfully fitted my new motor and connected the two wires to Fan and Neutral, but on hitting the switch, it didn't give so much as a twitch. I tried swapping the two wires (my understanding is for A/C motors this shouldn't make any difference) but it still didn't work.\\nMy questions:\\nThanks in advance.\\nEdit: The 3-in-1 is an Airflow Sunshine model 6600A, manufactured by Clipsal. Here's a picture. It's seen on page 5 of this brochure. Also on page 25 of this catalogue with technical data, although the unit depicted is slightly different to mine. I've contacted Clipsal and they've said they don't provide parts (and it's a discontinued model).\\n\",\n",

Over the past few months they\\'ve fried 3 USB chargers and when I try to watch a movie on a pico-projector (5V DC) it causes flickering and blacks out from time to time (usually right when the movie gets interesting). I should have isolated the problem to that outlet earlier, but I thought the whole house was electrically haunted.\\nFinally we stopped using those sockets, and I took it apart today. Nothing unusual in the wiring, no sign of burnt anything, no exposed wires. I put it back, turned the power back on to the apartment and measured it with a multimeter. Phase–neutral was OK, 220V, but ground–neutral was showing a 1..2V reading.\\nThe thing is I think this stray voltage varies (based on the projector problems during a 2h movie). This is why I was a bit reluctant to call an electrician, I don\\'t want someone to come, stay for a few minutes, notice nothing unusual and say everything is fine. Then charge me without fixing the issue.\\nI\\'d really like to use that outlet, it\\'s well placed for the projector. Otherwise the room would be criss-crossed with extension cords. What could I do?\\nI think the renovation was done by a hack electrician...\\nThat\\'s all the suspicious details I could conjure up for now.\\nI don\\'t have enough reputation to create value for the StackExchange community by answering bloody comments.\\nI haven\\'t checked ALL the receptacles, but two of them look perfectly fine. Tidy wiring even.\\nOne phase of 220V, I believe...\\nThe USB chargers weren\\'t particularly cheap ones, in fact. If overheating is a measure of poor quality, they didn\\'t do that. May they rest in peace.\\nThe outlets don\\'t have built-in USB. One of them has a built-in TV coax plug. Some light switches (SHOULD be different circuit) had light indicators that don\\'t work. Could have been they all burnt out before I moved in, which would have been a problem. But the owner came by today and told me she\\'s certain they had never connected those. I had issues with these before, and recall how I systematically tore out these little duplicitous \"conveniences\" and spat on their worthless corpse.\\nWe have CFL lights in other rooms, yeah. The washing machine has a regular Schuko plug.\\nI had an electrician come check it out. He brought in a voltage stabilizer (with servo-motor) and measured between 210V and 230V. The dips are probably the cause, and it means the electrical issues are for the whole apartment, not just that power outlet. He replaced it to be sure.\\nHis recommendation was to but a voltage stabilizer and plug valuables into that... I find that extremely cumbersome, and quite expensive, all for a \"fix\" that doesn\\'t address the core issue.\\nWhat other recourse do I have to get cleaner power to the entire flat? I\\'ll try to talk to the building\\'s administrator and to the power company, but what should I be aware of?\\n',\n",

I've got a dual-pole 25A breaker, and am completely replacing the existing outlet.\\nMy issue is that one appliance has a standard NEMA 6-15 plug, and the other just has a four-wire pigtail.  I'm trying to figure out how to wire them both up.\\nFor the four-wire appliance, it looks like the NEMA 14-20 is the correct plug to attach to it.  It should only draw 6 amps-- is there a lower-rated four-conductor plug I should use?\\nAs for the receptacle, my understanding is the 6-15 doesn't use the neutral wire.  Can I run 4 wires to a junction box and then have two outlets-- a 6-15 and a 14-20-- with the neutral only going to the 14-20?\\nAm I doing something terribly wrong or dangerous?  This doesn't seem too complicated, but I've heard enough horror stories to be cautious.\\nEDIT:\\nThe appliances are a table saw (13 amp draw) and a dust collector (6 amp draw).  There's not room in the breaker box for another set of breakers, so I was hoping to get both on the same circuit.  But it sounds like it's a better option to separate them?\\nThe wiring diagram for the dust collector doesn't help me much-- it can be wired for 230V or 460V operation and details how to change that, but never specifies what the four leads are for.  They're standard colors (black, red, white, green).\\nThe existing breaker is two 25A breakers with their handles attached.  Each connects between neutral and a different hot side in the box.  I went with 25A over 20A just because the draw from both appliances is 19A and that didn't seem like a lot of room in case one draws a bit more on startup.\\n\",\n",

We currently have 10/2.  While I have quite a bit of basic home and other electrical experience, we want to be sure that we add this new run properly since I haven\\'t done that before.\\nI\\'ve already started running the 8/3 and began about 1/3rd of distance by cutting out some ceiling and running one end down through an exposed HVAC return vent in the kitchen wall, through a few studs behind the fridge, and have wired it up to the installed oven next to there.\\nThe other end of the wire is a lot more fun since the house is 2 story without attic access anywhere.  From the opened ceiling above a walkway, we intend to bring the 8/3 down into 1\" EMT behind some new large cove moulding for about 6 feet, then into the wall and down about 6ft to run through a fireblock and under our stairs (an unfinished and not exposed area that I\\'m having to cut into from garage to access).  From there we\\'ll go back up the insulated exterior garage wall on the opposite side of the stairs.  At that point I\\'ll add a surface mount 4x4x1.5 steel box, and then 1\" EMT again along the garage ceiling and into the wall above the panel.\\nI know all about protecting the romex from damage (hence the EMT behind cove moulding and on garage ceiling), as well as stapling in the wall every 4\\' and securing the EMT to the ceiling, as well as most of the other basics.\\nMy main questions though before we work on the rest of this:\\n1)  Is it ok to have this cable non-continuous?  It may be significantly easier to run this cable through some of the EMT bends in the garage by having a splice (with junction box and proper #8 wire nuts of course) in at least one place, but obviously continuous wire (and especially ground) is better.  Additionally we bought a 125ft bundle but the total run should only be about 60-70ft, so that\\'s a lot of extra to pull.\\n2)  For the EMT to wall transitions in the garage, is it best to use a junction box?  I imagine so because the connection from there to EMT can be very solid, and then the hole at the back of the junction box is centered and provides more distance from the edge of the wall surface to the wire (1.25\" distance NEC rule).\\n3)  For the ceiling to EMT (behind cove moulding) to wall transitions, should we use bent EMT pipe through the sheetrock with tightened Romex to EMT adapters on the ends within the ceiling/wall, or could we just use a straight EMT pipe and add nailing plates on the back of the cove moulding at the ends where the cable comes out and goes into the ceiling/wall?  The latter seems easier since I don\\'t have a 1\" EMT bender (though realize I have to find one for the garage ceiling work).\\n4)  We have to add a new 40A double pole breaker in the panel for this.  Is it recommended to try and match the existing brand/model breakers exactly?\\n5)  Should we upgrade this circuit to AFIC?  We don\\'t currently have any and I\\'m not sure of the usefulness only on a 240v to oven/micro combo.\\nThank you!\\n',\n",

Prior to installing the LED light, I tested to ensure the fan motor worked with the remote control and it did at all speeds.  I hooked up the LED light as specified in the diagram (pretty easy, just snap the connectors together and screw down the plate). When I went back to the remote, it didn't work.  I have a wall power switch (nothing fancy just an off and on switch for power) that I turned off and then back on and then I pushed the light button on the remote and the light came on but I pushed the light off button on the remote and it didn't turn off.  So I went to turn the power switch off on the wall and then back on again.  I pushed the light off button on the remote again and this time the light went off (strange).  This also worked the same way with the fan speed.  I disconnected the light and I could operate the speed of the fan motor as well as turn it off and on with no problem.  Hooked back up the light and the remote went back to the somewhat non-functional way of not working like it suppose to. Thought it was the ceiling fan and swapped it out with a new one; same issue.  What is causing the remote not to work properly when the light is connected up to the ceiling fan?\\n\",\n",

He\\'s heard the previous tenant was probably running a big air compressor or welder. So I wired in an outlet with the 3 wires that were in there, a black and 2 blue. Here\\'s the resulting voltage:\\n\\nAfter reading these values I figured I screwed up, so I removed the plug and put everything back to how I found it. However, there was another 240v plug in the shop that was already there so I decided to test it and it read the same values.\\nViolet and red make sense, but green seems impossible??\\nHow is this possible? Is this normal? Was the previous tenant hooking up some non-standard machinery?\\nEDIT: Continuity between the 3 sockets is infinity, there\\'s no short, the plug seems good. The black wire was attached to the vertical slit (where violet and green meet). Black wire had a very low resistance to the conduit so I would say it\\'s \"safe\" to assume that\\'s the common rail and tied to ground as it should be.

I was in need of a new set due to troubles with our current washer and wasn\\'t all that happy with it when it was working. So, I when I found a Miele set available through an auction, I decided that I had to have them. It turns out that this series of Miele washer, the Touchtronic 1119, has a plug identical to the dryer.\\nAdding another circuit to the breaker panel is not an option, so I figured that I was SOL. However, after doing some research, I learned that Miele used to sell a 240v/30amp splitter, which didn\\'t make a whole lot of sense to me.\\nI found the manuals online. Each brochure states that the appliances only need 15 amps. Links and excerpts below:\\nFrom the dryer manual:\\nThe dryer comes with a 5 ft long, 12/4   AWG cord and a NEMA 14-30 P plug.   It should be connected to a   120/208-240 V, 15 A, 60 Hz AC power   supply. A 3 pole-4 wire grounding   power outlet (NEMA type 14-30 R) is   necessary.\\nhttps://www.mieleusa.com/forms2/us/sa/manuals-125.aspx?mNo=06610660&asDownload=1\\nFrom the Washing machine manual:\\nThe washing machine is supplied with a   5\\' 3\" (1.6 m) long, 4 wire cord, ending in   a NEMA 14-30 P plug, ready for   connection to a 120/208-240 V, 15 A,   60 Hz, AC power supply.\\nhttps://www.mieleusa.com/forms2/us/sa/manuals-125.aspx?mNo=06523260&asDownload=1\\nWith information collected from the brochure, I was able to find some images of the \"splitter\" from an old ebay auction. The seller, thankfully, opened the box to show the internals. See below:\\nMiele 240v, 30 amp splitter:\\nExternal:\\n\\nInternal:\\nI\\'m in no way an electrician, but that looks fairly simplistic. If I were to build my own, these are the parts that I would buy.\\nHaving reviewed the image a few times, I have to ask:\\nQ1: Are the fuses be necessary with the existing 30 amp breaker?\\nQ2: And, if they are not necessary, then can I just add a second receptacle to the existing one?\\nOne of the details that I have yet to mention was that the washing machine came with an outlet. It looks like the owner just ripped it out of the wall. I had planned to discard, but after doing all of this research, I wonder:\\nQ3: Did the previous owners have the same \"Just add a second outlet\" idea??\\nAs I see it, these are my options:\\nQ4: What are the issues and risks with the above options? Possibly illegal? (I ordered them from cheapest to most expensive; I\\'d expect that the order is, also, riskiest to least risky.)\\nThe inside of the dryer receptacle box (it\\'s a 10-30R) is shown below.\\n\\n',\n",

What should I use?\\nI\\'m not sure if crimp connectors are to code so I ended up twisting my stranded wire around the screws.  Everything works but it looks \"ugly\".  Are my connections bad?  Should I get crimp terminals?\\nAre my connections up to code?  Stranded wire is a PITA to work with but thats all home depot sells.

The garage is detached from the house and the original wiring was not easy so I'm wondering, does adding a GFCI breaker require running a separate neutral line or is it just a matter of changing something at the outlet and breaker?\\n\",\n",

The charger will charge my wife's car in the wee hours overnight.\\nThe charger also has the option of coming with a NEMA 6-50 plug rather than the 14-50, if that's a better option.\\nSometimes in the winter, I like to work in the garage. So, I got a plug-in heater that has a NEMA #6-30 plug and requires a 30A circuit.\\nI'd like to be able to unplug the charger and plug in the heater. Since the heater draws less power than the charger, as long as the circuit is sized for the charger I think this should be OK. Assuming so, here are what I see as my options:\\nChop the 6-30 plug off the heater and replace with a 14-50 (or 6-50) plug.\\nGet an adapter from 6-30 to 14-50 (or 6-50).\\nWould appreciate any thoughts on this: Is it feasible? Are there better options (aside from running a separate circuit for the heater)? Is there any advantage to getting the charger with a 6-50 rather than a 14-50? Is 8/3 Romex sufficient?\\nThanks,\\nAEP\\n\",\n",

I am an electronics technician (radios) so I am quite experiences with electronics and theory (although DC is my strength).\\nI checked all the routine no start issues, door switch, start switch and thermal resistor all have continuity when isolated. I checked voltages at the receptacle and on the distribution block of the dryer hot to hot-240V, neutral to hot A-118V, neutral to hot B-123V and nothing would happen when start was pressed.  I hit start and tried to spun the drum, nothing.  I ended up pulling the front panel completely off and removing the drum and checked that I have 118V on M4 of the motor switch. In order to check the motor I created a test cable from an extension cord and (cut the female end off and stripped the ends) and connected it to the dryer power distribution on the hot side that controls the motor (not the heater) and neutral then plugged it into a standard 120 wall outlet and the dryer started up like a champ so I knew the motor was good.  I then plugged the original cable back in and tried to start it and it didnt work.  I then opened the motor switch and the voltage all looked good.  I then manually shorted the relay for heating circuit on the motor switch and and the coil heated up.  I then ohmed out the timing switch and it was good.\\nI then opened the receptacle and put my multimeter probes on leg A and neutral, it read 118V and when I pressed the start button the it dropped to 0V and leg B was at 240V.  I thought it could be a open neutral (although I dont have much experience with neutrals being a DC guy but I am familiar with electronic theory) so I connected my multimeter between the common (ground) pin on the door switch and the bare neutral wire on the service panel and it read 1.3 ohms so there is neutral connectivity throughout the circuit (I also verified that all grounds had connectivity with the neutral in the service panel).\\nI am now at a loss as to where to go next.  I really don't have an idea of where to go next as every thing else in my apartment works as it should and I don't have the funds to hire an electrician or a repair man.  Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\\n\",\n",

The device is 220V, 50hz and 600watt.  The power cord (no plug) is 3 wires, and rated as 10amp.\\nIf I connect a dryer plug to this cord, will I be able to plug it in to my dryer receptacle?  Should I worry that the cord is only rated at 10amp?\\nAdditional Info: Power cord actually came with it unexpectedly (opened the box tonight) and it's plug is exactly the same as a typical 110V 3 prong grounded plug. Is this even possibly going to work?  I thought 220V required 2 hot, 1 neutral, optional ground?  In this configuration, I assume the normal ground plug is actually neutral and the two parallel plugs are both hot?  Is it a big deal if I don't ground the device?  Do they even make 220V capable receptacles approved for this purpose in this configuration?  Seems like a nightmare to have a 220V unit hanging around with the same plug/receptacle as a 110V device!!!  Accident waiting to happen?!\\nThis is actually a oil-less piston air pump (not a motor), in case it matters.\\n\",\n",

Hooked up dryer, switched to 3 prong plug. Dryer ran fine, started to smell like burning plastic until it stopped running altogether. Dryer is fine, power cable apparently gave out. New power cable, dryer comes on, but no heat. It turns out the problem is really somewhere in the electrical.\\nI have a cheap voltmeter that only gives four readings 120, 240, 277, and over 400.\\nThis morning I measured each leg at the receptacle for 120v to ground. Together, both hots only measured 120v, which makes no sense to anybody I've asked. At the dryer, each hot to neutral read the same 120v, but together give no reading.\\nLooking at the breaker each hot to neutral is 120v, and together the voltmeter says 277v. I noticed the breaker was a 40 amp which probably contributed to this mess. I replaced it with a 30 amp and the readings stayed the same. All of my double pole breakers give the reading of 277v. I also replaced the tired-looking receptacle that was probably original to the house on the hopes that maybe it was the cause to the problem. All readings were the same.\\nNow that I'm home from work, I have different readings at the dryer and the outlet. One hot says 120v to ground and the other gives no readings at all. Both hots together are also 0. Nothing has changed between this and my earlier reading. I was very careful switching the breaker out because I don't want to die and don't want to cause another problem somewhere else.\\nWhat's going on? Who am I? What dark force is keeping me from doing laundry?\\nI'm willing to guess that my five dollar probe isn't known for its accuracy. On the off chance my house is getting 277v, what would that mean for my appliances and whether or not my house is going to burn down?\\nI tested everything again this morning, and both legs read 120 to ground, and I know that one leg wasn't doing that eight hours before. Clearly the line from box to receptacle is doing something it shouldn't. Luckily both dryer and breaker box are in my garage and I can follow the cable up from the box, across the unfinished joists, and into the drywall behind the dryer. I don't have to cave in several walls around the house to get to anything. Is this something an amateur can fix with the right materials and the help of other amateurs that know what 240v feels like?\\n\",\n",

I'm moving the oven into an island, which requires moving the 240 line used for the oven.\\nThe original plan was to relocate the current 240 line into the utility room and then run a new line from there to the oven, and splice these connections in a junction box. However this plan is not panning out as the old 240 line is aluminum, not copper, and is only 2 hots and shared ground/neutral rather then the R/B/W/G 4-wire copper that is commonly used today. Mixing aluminum and copper is not a good idea, so rather than proceed with this plan I'd like to look at alternatives.\\nRun a new 240 line from the breaker box to the location needed for the island. This is what I'd like to do, but I'm unsure of the type of wire and conduit to use. Here is a picture of the back of the house, with breaker box, with the red line being an idea of where to run conduit for this wire:\\n\\nMy questions are, which conduit do I use; EMT or PVC (such. 80 of course)? And which wire do I use? This wire will run right in-between the floor joists when it enters the house, so individual wires probably won't work, so what insulated wire should I use? UF is the only option, right? This will be a 40 amp circuit, so I was thinking 6 gauge, just for overkill.\\nSince I've already got the new copper wire ran from the basement utility room to the island location, I could just run individual THWN through conduit from the breaker box straight down and in to the utility room and then splice this in a junction box to the wire I already ran. At least in this case I'm splicing copper to copper which makes me less nervous. But the individual wires need to be in conduit inside the house as well, correct? How do I handle the area from where the wires enter the house until they hit the junction box (about 4-5 feet maybe)?\\nAlso, here is a shot of the area where the line would come in to the utility room. You can see the new NM 6-3 wire right next to the old aluminum wire there on the right, with the outside of the house being on the left. The original plan was to just splice those two together...\\n\\nSo that's where I'm at. Any and all help/advice is greatly appreciated.\\n\",\n",

This is my first attempt at any kind of electrical work, so finding weird things makes me nervous.\\nIt appears that my house (built in 1905 and remodeled several times before I bought it in 2004) used to have an electric oven. It now has a gas oven and a 110V 20 amp circuit that is supposed to power the electrical part of the oven (a clock and the ignition for the burners and oven) and a microwave/hood combo.\\nWhen I took off the oven faceplate, I found a 240V box behind it with big white and black multi-stranded wires (and a ground). It appears that someone used one strand of each of the big wires and attached that to the outlet's terminal screws. Then they used wire nuts and pigtails to run normal 12/2 (w/ ground) wire up to the microwave/hood.\\nHow should I deal with the 240V cable that runs from the breaker box to the outlet? Do I need to pull it out and replace it? Is there a way to wire nut a 240V stranded wire to a 120V wire, and is that an okay thing to do? I realize that as long as the breaker is only 120V, the wire is just bigger than it needs to be, but I worry that someone might see the 240V wire at the breaker and try connecting a 240V circuit without checking for smaller gauge wire downstream. Best I can tell, the 240V cable runs in one piece from the breaker box all the way to the outlet.\\nPictures:\\n\\n\",\n",

Anyway, I bought a new dryer and hooked it up and it too requires the button to be held in until it ramps up and will then run. When a load of clothes is put in it, it tries to turn very slowly and will not start. Now for the voltage measurements:\\nat the 3 prong outlet: 240vac from leg to leg 120vac from each leg to neutral\\nat the breaker: same measurements leg to leg 120vac from each leg to ground\\nThe only other thing I noticed is that on one side of the breaker, the voltage jumped up to @180vac when I had someone hold in the start button on the dryer until it got started. Since V=IR, wouldn\\'t that increase in voltage indicate that the current would decrease (assuming a steady resistance)?

My intuition would be that washers and dryers are usually on their own circuit for a reason, and running a heavy duty extension cord would be a bad idea.\\nSo what do we need to do to hook this up?

About twenty-five years ago, I installed a new 29,200 BTU Carrier A/C through the wall of the house.  The unit was rated at 208v, drawing 15.1 Amps.\\nThe house was built with a \"standard-sized\" A/C sleeve through the wall, serviced by a solid-copper-wire, steel-armored, 12/2-BX cable, with a single-pole 120v, 20-Amp dedicated circuit breaker receptacle next to the sleeve.\\nI ripped-out the \"standard-sized\" sleeve, replacing it with an oversized sleeve designed to house the new A/C.  However, as to the original solid-copper-wire, steel-armored, 12/2-BX cabled, 120v, single-pole 20-Amp dedicated circuit breaker receptacle, I replaced it with a new 240v receptacle.  Then I ran a second solid-copper-wire, steel-armored, 12/2-BX cable from the steel main-panel box back to the new 240v receptacle (A distance of about 35-feet!), and then I installed a new 20-Amp double-pole dedicated circuit breaker in the steel main-panel box.\\nI then \"jury-rigged\" the two 12/2-BX cables by twisting and capping the two black wires together and running a short \"pigtail\" to one of the \"Hot\" 240v receptacle leads, and then twisting and capping the two white wires together and again running another short \"pigtail\" to the other \"Hot\" 240v receptacle lead.  I then ran another short \"pigtail\" from \"Neutral/Ground\" 240v receptacle lead back to the steel receptacle box, thereby converting the steel receptacle box and the steel-armor of the BX cable itself into the \"Neutral/Ground\" lead.\\nAt the steel main-panel box, where I installed the 20-Amp double-pole dedicated circuit breaker, I again \"jury-rigged\" the two black 12/2-BX cables by twisting them together and attaching them to one of the 20-Amp dedicated circuit breaker poles, and I then twisted together the two white 12/2-BX cables and attached them to the other 20-Amp dedicated circuit breaker pole.  I then securely affixed the two independent steel-armored 12/2-BX cables to the steel main-panel box, and for \"good-measure\" ran a \"pigtail\" from the steel-armor of the BX cables to the \"Neutral/Ground\" bar of the steel main-panel box.\\nHaving said all that, I need to say that (1) I was shown this \"jury-rigging-maneuver\" by an \"old-time-electrician\" who claimed to have \"converted hundreds\" of 120v circuits to 240v circuits by the aforementioned \"method\", and (2) my oversized 29,200 BTU, 208v, 15.1-Amp A/C worked perfectly fine for the better-part of a quarter-of-a-century!\\nFast-forward twenty-five years and the old 29,200 BTU A/C is dead!  However, I found a newer (About ten-years old and in great condition!) Carrier A/C on eBay for a fraction of the cost of a new one, and while the physical dimensions of the newer A/C are identical to the dimensions of the old one, the power requirements of the newer A/C are more \"demanding\".\\nWhile this newer unit is rated at the same 208v, it\\'s putting out 32,200 BTUs, while drawing 19.4-Amps and generating 3,930-Watts!  Carrier\\'s specifications require that this newer A/C be run on a 30-Amp double-pole dedicated circuit breaker, and while it\\'s simple-enough to replace the 20-Amp dedicated circuit breaker with a new 30-Amp dedicated circuit breaker in the steel main-panel box, I\\'m concerned about the efficacy/safety of my \"jury-rigged\" wiring, especially using the converted steel receptacle box and the steel-armor of the BX cable itself as the \"Neutral/Ground\" lead.\\nFrom cruising the Internet, it appears that a 12-guage solid-copper wire can safely handle up to a 20.0-Amp load and up to 3,840-Watts at 240v, and that by twisting together a pair of 12-guage solid-copper wires it should produce the functional equivalent of a 9-guage solid-copper wire, which should boost its capacity to somewhere around 35-Amps and about 6,500-Watts at 240v.  That said, I\\'m anxious of the merit of continuing to use the \"jury-rigged\" steel-armor of the BX cables as the \"Neutral/Ground\" means to continue to safely handle the power demands this newer replacement A/C.\\nSorry for this \"long-winded\" depiction, but as my quandary concerns a potential safety-issue versus the time and expense of ripping-out the twin 12/2-BX cables and running a single 10/3 (or possibly even an 8/3) cable, I wanted to be as precise as possible in relating my circumstances.\\n',\n",

It\\'s problematic since I can\\'t really work with the ABS under the floor. It wasn\\'t done properly and has the drain for the tub, the sink and the toilet all going into the same toilet drain. See photos below. To do it correctly would cost around $5K, according to a quote we got from a plumber recently.\\nTo summarize from my previous thread I removed three layers of linoleum, two layers of fir planking and am now down to the bare joists. I cut away the flared portion of the flange and as you can see the hubs for both the ABS align with the hub of the offset flange. Meaning, they are both four inches in diameter. Also, now that so many layers of flooring has been removed I am wondering if I can shave off a bit of the hub from both the ABS drain pipe in the floor along with removing part of the hub from the offset flange to help bring it down lower. The hubs on both measure 1.5\" in length. If I can remove an inch off of each hub to eliminate two inches and be left with just one inch to work with this would help a lot.\\nI thought I could buy some ABS piping that could fit inside both the flange hub and ABS hub in the floor. It would basically be a one inch ring connecting both hubs from the inside.\\nOnce I put my 3/4\" plywood over the joists, cement sheet rock and possibly a leveling compound followed by 1\" hexagon porcelain tile I am confident that I can get the metal ring of the offset flange to sit flush against the new final height of the floor.\\nBut I am wondering if my idea is bad one or if anyone can suggest better ideas. I really want to use the offset flange to not only give me about an extra inch from the back wall but also want to place it diagonally to allow an extra inch away from the side wall. It\\'s a bit too close to the side wall. This is a 2\" offset flange, by the way.\\nI\\'ve also included a very bad drawing to help provide a visual as far as getting my idea across without any confusion.\\nA summary with pics:\\nHere is a pic of the old flange in place:\\nAfter sawing off the flared portion of the flange I am left with this:  I am going to attempt to carefully grind away the rest of the flange that is bonded on the inside of the ABS in the floor to be able to re-bond the new ABS \"ring\" I will cut to size to connect the new offset flange in place.\\nAnother angle where you can see all the the other ABS drain lines that connect to the toilet drain line:  ^ This is why I simply can\\'t just extend the horizontal portion of the ABS under the floor to give me a 12\" rough-in. I\\' have to redo all the drain pipes that connect to one drain. It would be a real pain.\\nSetting my new offset 4x3 flange on top of the ABS hub in the floor. They are the same diameter:\\nMy (very bad) drawing summarizing what I am trying to do:\\nAfter sawing away the old flared portion of the flange I can see that only about a half inch of ABS from the old flange made a permanent bond with the ABS drain pipe in the floor. So this is why I am wondering if I can make the hubs a half inch in length and create a \"ring\" with ABS to fit inside each one to make this work.\\nHope to hear back and get some input, thanks!\\n',\n",

The plastic will be ABS, PVC and acryl (not sure if that is the correct English term, I mean the clear stuff they make aquarium walls from). I've got several pieces of each material and I need to do it one-handed standing on a ladder. The pieces of plastic are mounted on a frame high up on a wall. (One hand for the ladder, the other for the cordless power-drill.) Luckily for me neatness isn't important. The holes don't need to be at a very exact angle as long as they are more or less straight in and go all the way through. Some raggedness of the holes, even a bit of melting at the edges due to the drill-bit getting warm is OK as the holes won't be visible from up close. Splintering the plastic however is NOT OK and I only have one go at this. The pieces of plastic can not be easily replaced if they crack or splinter...\\nI intend to use a 2 mm drill for steel, set the power-drill for high-speed and apply little pressure when drilling. I think the acryl and the ABS would be a bit to hard/brittle for a wood-drill (For the PVC it would probably be OK). Obviously I need to let the drill-bit cool a bit between holes and maybe drill each hole through in 2-3 phases, possibly having to clean plastic residue from the drill each time. Am I on the right track with this or will I be making a big mistake somewhere?\\nEDIT in response to various comments. The plastic pieces are mostly horizontal inserts of a (much larger) company logo mounted on the roof/wall of a company building. It can't be disassembled without breakage (lot's of glue and some pieces were molded in place and wrap around the frame). The horizontal parts of the construct gather rain-water which leads to moss-growth (eye-sore) and which provide ideal nesting-places for pigeons and sea-gulls (bird-shit and the noise of the gulls). Management contacted the artist who designed the whole thing and he came up with the brilliant idea of drilling the holes. About half of them to let water run of and the other half to insert 12-15 cm transparent (so they are invisible from the ground) plastic rods to deny the birds access. The artist is a cousin of the CEO. The CEO is heavily impressed by him and basically orders us to follow the artists every whim. Access to the panels with a ladder is pretty good. I'm not worried about dangerous working conditions. Scaffolding only works for the lower panels. The upper panels are mostly located in recesses that are wide enough to get a ladder in, but to narrow for a scaffold. (For the lower part I will use a cherry-picker. That is a lot easier than a scaffold and gives me the same access.)\\n\",\n",

The only power that stays on is the hallway power (thermostat is located in hallway), one bedroom power, and guest restroom power...other than that - all power is out (inside, outside, garage, kitchen, etc) We check the breakers and all breakers look good and nothing seems to be popped or out of the ordinary. The weird thing is the only way to get the rest of the power back on is if we get the ac going by turning the temp down, just so it can trigger on.\\nAny ideas on this? Any help or guidance would be appreciated. Not sure how to go about troubleshooting this issue. —————update Below ———— From what centerpoint said when they came out is everything is getting power and all properly, but when he pulled the breaker for the ac out, it was all melted and bud bars had some burning on it.

Initially it was turning on but constantly short cycling every 30 seconds. Now the unit is only blowing air via the fan. Does anyone know why this is happening? It is a relatively new unit and it was working perfectly fine until I replaced the filter. Thanks.\\nThe brand and model of the HVAC unit is National Comfort Brands, Model CPG41238-U23\\nSo currently the unit says its cooling according to my thermostat but it clearly is not as the temperature on the thermostat has been at 78 all day and I have the temperature set to 70. There is no cold air coming out of the vents, just the fan seems to be on. I checked to see if the heating works and it seems to be working just fine. The cooling is just not working. I looked for the switch that dandavis mentioned and there is a switch that seems to be triggered when the slotted door to the filter is opened/closed. There is no actual switch or anything that is directly touching the filter, only the slotted door. I turned the cooling off via the thermostat and then I turned the unit off using the lightswitch located near the unit. I checked the circuit breaker and nothing was tripped. I turned off the unit via the circuit breaker, waited 1 minute then flipped the circuit back on, then turned the unit on via the lightswitch, waited for my thermostat to reboot then turned on cooling. Still no luck. Here are some attached pictures of the units filter area including the switch I Found, the thermostat reading, as well as more information about the model. Thanks again for the help.\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/c3whP4V\\nAlso, the outside unit is not blowing out any air either.\\nSo I consulted with some other people and they are saying that since the thermostat is on cooling, the inside vents are blowing out room temperature air, the outside unit is not blowing out any air, and the circuit breaker was not tripped, they are saying that likely the capacitor is lacking a hard start kit. Since apparently changing the filter requires opening the slotted door which causes the shut off switch to be triggered and as a result the capacitor is having a hard time starting back up without a hard start kit. If anyone agrees or disagrees please let me know, I would really appreciate it. Thanks again for all your responses!\\n',\n",

This is a serious issue from a first-cost perspective (one sewage or greywater pump per fixture) and a service/maintenance perspective (broken pump means inoperable fixture and icky service job), never mind the issue of not being able to run any water when the power goes out (or having to provide standby power to the pumps).  Running all the utilities in the walls suffers from a similar problem, as well as forcing labryinthine utility routes over doors and around hallways, so it is not an option either.\\nThis leaves the idea of an inverted crawlspace setup, where a set of non-structural floor joists are set atop the structural floor slab (with their bottom plates resting atop the slab), with a non-structural subfloor and finish floor set atop the floor joists, forming a space suitable for utility routing.  This provides room for all the utilities a house or apartment needs, as:\\nGiven that the joists forming the crawlspace are going to either be wooden floor trusses, steel open web bar joists, or steel/wood composite bar joists, as wooden I-joists are much more limiting when it comes to utility routing due to web boring limits, this all works out nicely, save for one issue: how can one fit access hatches to this space for post-construction use?  Note that I want to be able to use normal residential floor finishes to at least some extent, instead of being limited to commercial-style carpet square systems: at the very minimum, tile and floating wood need to be supported by this scheme, while a carpet option would be a nice-to-have as well.  Furthermore, one must be able to access the entire space this way, instead of some small portion of it; having a handful of hatches is acceptable, but requiring say, one hatch per joist bay, would be considered excessive here.\\n',\n",

I've eliminated mold everywhere I've found it except in the inaccessible crawlspace under a kitchen and bedroom addition (1960s? 70s?). I've fixed leaks and replaced drywall, ductwork, etc but I can still smell mold coming up from the crawlspace, which has no access panel but several vents. The height ranges from about 10 inches under the kitchen (worst mold area) to 2 feet at one bedroom corner. I don't know how to get rid of the mold under the addition: seal it and find a way to keep it dehumidified? pay someone to spray foam underneath? install ultraviolet lamps somehow to kill the mold?

I have a good route up a 10\"x18\" chase currently occupied by only a few water pipes, which leads to a second-floor utility closet from which I can run directly to the attic.\\nThe problem is that getting up to the chase from the basement requires running the cables under the duct of a bathroom exhaust fan, and from the side of the wall where I currently have access, I don\\'t think I\\'m going to be able to successfully pull the cables without inadvertently damaging them on a support bracket or ending up with too small a bend radius.\\nI can get access directly under the chase in order to pull the cables and ensure they clear the duct and have the proper bend radius, but such access from below will require cutting a hole in the ceiling at the back of a shower stall in a basement bathroom. Given the location, I have some concerns/questions:\\n1) Is this a really bad idea? Since I haven\\'t cut it yet, I don\\'t know yet what water/moisture-proofing measures are in place--my view from an inspection camera suggests there is nothing but drywall--but I don\\'t want to create a world of pain for myself if making this hole is going to be hard to patch.\\n2) Since I would like the option to run additional cables in the future, I was thinking of putting an access panel in the ceiling rather than just patching the drywall. Are there products that would be appropriate for this environment, or is that asking for trouble as well and I would be better off cutting and patching drywall?\\nI hope I explained my situation clearly enough.\\n',\n",

The cover to the attic is showing signs of wear, replacing the cover with a maple hatch would be easy. Who wants easy, though?\\nThere isn\\'t a lot of clearance for stairs. The following image illustrates the dimensions in context:\\n\\nThe red lines show that a space-limiting beam extends down to the same height as the top of the door frames. The beam restricts the amount of space available for a ladder. The short blue line shows the distance between the beam and the edge of the attic entrance--this is a straight measurement flush with the ceiling.\\nThe long blue line shows the distance between the bottom of the beam and the hinge-side edge of the attic hatch. Pythagoras suggests that the beam\\'s height is 15.5\" and the angle (from the would-be hatch\\'s hinge-side to beam bottom) is 28.7 degrees.\\nSpeaking of degrees... There\\'s a stainless steel hot water tank in the attic that, presumably, will need to come down some year. This implies that the installation must be reasonably easy to remove or not significantly reduce the miserly 26\" of clearance.\\nWhat types of attic ladders--or other built-in solutions--would accommodate such a cramped space (e.g., scissor attic ladders)?\\n',\n",

Single story maximum height is 18\\' where I live (San Jose, CA). Additionally, basements must have an emergency exit in every room, which can be an emergency exit window, provided that the sill height of the window doesn\\'t exceed 44\" above finished floor and the window meets certain height and width and area requirements.\\nIf the finished basement floor is 36\" (3\\') below grade, and the sill height of the emergency windows are 44\" above the finished basement floor (to meet emergency exit requirements), they will end up 8\" above grade. With an 8\\' ceiling in the basement, this means the 1st floor finished height above grade will be 5\\' plus the thickness of the floor/ceiling separating the basement from the first floor. Depending on construction technique, I could imaging this being as little as 5\" (post tension concrete slab) to as much as 14.125\" (2\"x12\" floor joists, 5/8\" rock below, 3/4\" plywood above, 3/4\" flooring above plywood). This would put the finished first floor level anywhere from 5\\' 5\" to 6\\' 2.125\" above grade. With a 8\\' ceiling and a flat roof, I think I can stay below the 18\\' overall height requirement, but I\\'m not sure about whether this finished first floor level height is too high or not. Obviously it would necessitate an entrance with some sort of exterior landing and stairs, but that seems solvable (a portion of my current home has a floor at 40\" above grade with a landing and set of stairs), if a bit higher than your typical ground level with crawl space home.\\nSo, how high is too high for the finished first floor level? Said another way, if you took a 2 story ADU structure with the first floor slightly above grade, how far do you have to transition it below grade before the first floor now is called a basement and the entire structure can be considered a \"single story\"?\\n',\n",

The only solution I can think of at this point is to cut a slot in each of the pans to allow for the clamp and wire to come down far enough that I can rotate the box of out the hole.  For the one junction with more lines, I figure I'll have to dig the remodel clamps out of the trash and wait for the drywall to go up and cut the hole as large as possible.  Are there flush clamps that will not protude from the the knockouts or something?\\nUPDATE: I went by the neighborhood hardware store and got some plastic push-through 'clamps'.  They are almost flush with the outside of the box.  I'm hoping this will resolve my issue for at least the simple configurations.\\n\",\n",

I need someone with experience and knowledge to help me out.\\nI have a relatively squarish room and I would like to accomplish, as much as possible, the following :\\nI have seen a billion different panels and I have no clue what to use. I\\'ve seen people place bass traps in corners, other use the same panels everwhere, others even place only a couple of panels here and there.\\nI was thinking of buying a little of all panels but that seems rather idiotic.\\nI know there are millions of parameter to take into account, but I don\\'t specifically need a studio quality (if I can that\\'s great).\\nThe current situation is the following :\\nReverb is rather insane ; currently room is empty. I\\'ve recorded a small video (not meant to show the room, more meant to have a memory of how it sounded before I placed my acoustic mods), here it is :  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mszS2X7CDFgL02HJP7NqBhK-Uih_SReh/view?usp=sharing\\nYou can have a good look of the room there which might help you. The video is really just me talking to the cam saying nothing interesting, for the sake of making sound in that room.\\nHere are the relevant sounds :\\nI will probably never have deep bass or stuff like that and I don\\'t intend to record music, it will always be my voice, at all times. So the frequency range should be easier to manage, I hope.\\nI have also installed a software that I thought would help, called EQ Room Wizard, but I am not experienced enough in acoustics to use it (at all).\\nNow from what I\\'ve found, thomann provides a lot of choice and information on what you can buy ; amazon too but less. I\\'ve found various prices and types, and looked it up a bit. Thing is, like I said, I don\\'t know what type of foam I need to buy. I see keywords/acronyms like SA, WAS, SN, Wedge, and numbers all over which I have no idea what they mean.\\nI really need someone to tell me the basics that will give best result vs time/money invested. Like : \"buy 4 panels of that type and put them near window, then fill the walls with that other type of panel, and put xxx close to the ground.\"\\nI\\'m making things up obviously, but what I mean is, I don\\'t want you gusy to give me a millimeter answer (unless you wanna somehow spend the time to make this the perfect studio)\\nI have given as much information as possible, feel free to ask more questions if necessary.\\nI hope that was enough !\\nAnd of course, thank you very much for even reading this far\\n',\n",

However, what if you can\\'t get behind the electrical box?  In my case, I have a wall floating on hat channels about 3\" from the studs.  The electrical box I will be using is an old work box with a clamp that allows the box to be fastened to the drywall rather than studs.  This means that I will not be able to get to the backside of the box to apply the putty.  I though about putting it around the outside of the box before sliding it through, but that doesn\\'t seem like it would be very stable.\\nThis leads me to me idea of putting the putty on the inside.  I uploaded pics of a mock application.  The outlet fits well and I think there would be plenty of room for the wires.  I know next to nothing about electrical, though, and I worry about not accounting for things that might not play well with the putty.\\nDoes anyone advise against this?  I hope not because it\\'s really the only way I can do this.\\n\\n\\nUpdate:\\nHere\\'s what I ended up doing.  At first, I had a hard time understanding Evil Greebo\\'s diagram, but I think this was the general idea he was conveying.\\nFirst, I cut out the smaller hole for my outlet.  Then I cut out the entire section 2\" around the outlet hole.\\n\\nI installed some support boards on either side of the opening.\\n\\nI used an old work box with adjustable flanges and installed it into the cut-out.\\n\\nI then covered it with my acoustic putty (QuietPutty) and left an opening for the wires.  Looks like some kind of alien organ, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nI ran the wires into it and then packed the putty tightly around the wires for good measure.  A flathead screwdriver worked great for packing and manipulating the putty.\\n\\nFinally, I placed the section into the wall and screwed it into the support boards.  My pic only shows two screws, but I actually screwed in all for corners.\\n\\nIf anyone else can think of a better way to do this, let me know because I am about to do it again, but this time with 5 outlets, one of which is a two ganger.\\n',\n",

PMMA is classified as a \"thermoplastic\" (as opposed to \"thermoset\"), and the name has to do with the way the plastic responds to heat. Thermoplastic materials become liquid at their melting point (160 degrees Celsius in the case of Acrylic). A major useful attribute about thermoplastics is that they can be heated to their melting point, cooled, and reheated again without significant degradation.   https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/injection-mold-3d-print-cnc-acrylic-plastic-pmma\\n',\n",

(It will be open at the top and will be used to house a hamster, so no hinges are needed.)\\nCan I use small nails?\\nShould I drill a very fine pilot hole?\\nIf the nail idea is no good, then should I use a special adhesive, or should I use screws?\\nI do not have clamps and I do not have any special drill bits.  If you want me to buy a special drill bit that doesn\\'t cost more than $15 and that\\'s available at Lowe\\'s or Home Depot I\\'m game.\\nEdit:\\nI followed the recommendations and it worked great.  Very fine bit first, dipped in the dish soap.  Went partway into the wood too.  Then switched to a slightly larger bit and didn\\'t go into the wood.  (Particle board, actually.)  The fine nails (1 1/4 \" long) went in nice and straight thanks to the partial pilot hole.  Used a slow speed and didn\\'t push much.  Operated drill while removing the drill from the hole.  Made sure not to overhammer the nails.\\nI left the outer backing film on, to reinforce.\\nTip: to remove the inner backing film, I rolled it up with a heavy cardboard mailing tube (borrowed from hamster).\\nComments: the plexiglass didn\\'t slide around even though I didn\\'t have clamps.  The drill bit never got hot but I did periodically dip it in the dish soap and I had the sense this was helpful.\\nConclusion: faster and easier than it would have been with screws.\\n',\n",

My only concern is: Would I be able to practically use IR remote when the sensors are behind acrylic glass?\\nI've found this information on Wikipedia:\\nPMMA passes infrared light of up to 2,800 nm and blocks IR of longer wavelengths up to 25,000 nm. Colored PMMA varieties allow specific IR wavelengths to pass while blocking visible light (for remote control or heat sensor applications, for example).\\nDoes it mean that plain transparent PMMA will pass beam from IR remote or I need some special coloured variation?

I need to attach the armor to my body, and I bought 1.5\" nylon webbing, some slide lock buckles, and some velcro. The plan is to attach the webbing to one piece of armor, with one end looped through one of the loops of the buckle, and sewn back on itself. Then I can run the strap from the other piece of armor through the other loop in the buckle and velcro it against itself. It will work something like this picture.\\nI need to adhere the nylon webbing to the acrylic. I know there are tons of adhesives and solvents for adhering acrylic to acrylic, but I\\'m not sure about nylon to acrylic and searching the web hasn\\'t found me anything useful.

We had to wait until the hair grew out and it was cut off.  Hair dye would not even cover the paint. I think a couple of the reasons we were unsuccessful was the amount of time that went by before we noticed the issue and the fact the hair seemed more porous due to the condition it was in to begin with.  We think it was porous due to the frequency of the hair dyes and the very dry nature of Colorado's weather.\\n\",\n",

The final install goal is to have the line power (120v) controlled by a pre-installed light switch (1-way) which currently operates 4 pot lights above my kitchen sink. This means one switch will control 3 LED lights and 4 pot lights. I haven't gotten that far though, has I have hit a bump in the road. I removed the AC adapter module board from the wall adapter, so that I can discretely install it in the junction box with the switch and soldered two leads onto the board for attaching to the switch. I then terminated the soldered leads to the switch L to the hot wire and N to the switched wire, before I had the chance to test the operation my LED light turned on right away, but my 4 pot lights were off, I flipped the switch and the LED shut off and the pot lights turned on. I then reversed my two soldered leads, but it didn't make a difference. I'm not sure if this is common for LED lights, or if it is maybe some sort of electrical component on the module board that somehow only conducts to the load when the line has no power, but that doesn't make sense because its meant to plug into a wall socket, which is always live.\\nWhy is my LED on when switched off but off when switched on?\\n\",\n",

I currently rent, but I am planning on buying a house in the next two years, and I want to get started on planning for this project. My wife is a houseplant enthusiast, and I want to build her a solarium / four seasons room / pseudo greenhouse. Since I don\\'t even have a house yet, I want to keep my project vague / flexible in terms of dimensions. Additional note: I am not against hiring pros or trying to do the entire thing myself. Ideally I could identify which design elements are feasible, which require assistance, which bring undue cost / complications, etc.\\nMy current conception for this project is something like this. The semi-circular design is greatly preferred, as that would maximize window area, but I am open to compromises if this is too. As stated earlier, the dimensions are not greatly important, but essentially, i would like a semi-circular solarium with roof with a radius of 12-15 feet, with a height of 16 or so feet (1.5 stories). The current design in sketchup involves taking 6x6 posts and cutting them at angles on each side (forming a trapezoid), and then making another cut to create a pentagonal post which would fit the windows square but take care of the angle change. Hard to explain, so see this picture. So that is the desire for the structure as a whole. Now I will list some of the specifications\\nHigh humidity environment - this room would be kept >70% humidity year round.\\nWater connection - I would have a humidifier in the room, and it would need to be connected to the tap water / plumbing\\nConstant temperature environment - the room would be kept between 72 and 75 degrees F year round. The house will always be at a lower temperature than this. In an ideal world, there would be some way for me to disconnect and reconnect the room to the house HVAC at will. I wonder if there is some kind of vent to accomplish this? I am a big smart-home person, and I am capable of building custom electronics to control a vent in the wall or something like that.\\nDraining or water tolerant flooring - My true desire would be to have a teak / cedar slat floor with a graded concrete slab / drain underneath, however I believe this would be extremely expensive. The ideal would be that a hose or watering can could be used very freely without water pooling. I am open to suggestions. Since the water would collect below the floor, I imagine a sump pump would need to be used?\\nFixed windows + vents - in an effort to keep the cost down, i would prefer if the windows were fixed, but there could be a top layer of smaller windows with automatic venting to keep cooling costs down in the summer. Is there like a cheap supplier of windows that offices used for their large floor to ceiling windows? I know they would need to be relatively thick to hold any kind of insulating effect.\\nsummer heat exhaust / heat management - since Ohio summers are hot and humid, I would like the ability to open the window vents and pull in outside air to replace the heated air escaping through the vents due to convection. I know people use large amounts of water to create a heat battery of sorts. any ideas on this would be great. Ideally, the room would never go over 85F, since that would limit the types of plants that could survive in that environment. Evaporative cooling would work to some extent, since the goal is to humidify the room anyways.\\nweatherproofing - I am not sure how moisture and similar considerations impact this. Since the room would be kept at high humidity, and the walls would be made mostly of glass and solid wood, I wonder how much of a concern this is. What measure could be taken to increase the longevity of the room in a high humidity environment\\nroof - I know that the semicircular design most likely complicates the roof. And I know very little about roofs. Any suggestions on tips to execute it well? Also, my father in law is a roofer by trade, so I would have some degree of professional help.\\nhanging rails - since this room is for plants, there will be many pieces of pipe installed in various ways for my wife to hang plants. If i can find a local shop willing to do so, I would have a piece of pipe curved to slightly less than the outer radius of the room (in a few pieces) and have a curved rail going around at multiple levels\\n(Idea) Curved librarians ladder - since there will be hanging plants, one idea I had was to build a ladder that could slide around the perimeter of the room, like a librarians ladder. My idea was to build a curved track, install it into the ceiling, and then attached a ladder with caster on the bottom. That way the ladder could be moved to different sections of the room for easy watering.\\n(Idea) hanging couch / seat - since the plants will be on the outside of the room, the inner area will have some seating. One stupid idea would be to build a hanging bed couch, allowing for some gentle swinging. Since this structure is essentially half of a dome, putting signifcant weight on the trusses near the apex of the dome shouldn\\'t be much of a problem, however I know a lot of that weight would get redistributed in the wall the dome is attached to. I imagine to make this project work I would have to work with the existing house structure in a smart way, but since I dont have a house, I dont know how it will work.\\nSo there is my over-idealistic project idea - I would love any and all feedback - even \"are you crazy???\". I am definitely aware that this is a pretty significant project and will probably cost me way too much money. Budget-wise I am very open but I would rather do something myself and struggle with it than shell out a ton of money and have someone else do ti for me, if that makes sense.\\nThanks in advance for all of your input!\\n',\n",

As I am a renter I do not want to cut out a piece of the door frame in order to notch the bar (or 2 x 4) in. Does anyone have any recommendations on what I should do? Note the door does not actually close so I would entertain anything up to and including the removal of the door.\\nI googled online and cannot find anything that gives me any ideas.\\nExample pull up  https://www.target.com/p/perfect-fitness-multi-gym/-/A-79786741?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&CPNG=PLA_Sports%2BShopping&adgroup=SC_Sports&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=c&location=9003433&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1248099&ds_rl=1246978&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIne6EzqXI6AIVxZ6zCh3WdQ69EAQYAyABEgI3lvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\\n',\n",

My house currently has the 3 car garage and I would like to convert it to the super family room. I pulled the original building plans (which are terrible quality) but I can tell that the current wall separating the tandem garage from the house is not load bearing. I feel like this should be a fairly straight forward conversion but after talking to drafting professionals and contractors they seem to make it out to be a much larger job and have left me with a couple specific questions:\\nThe current garage floor slopes from back to front (as expected) 1 3/4 inches to 4 inches. I am wondering what the proper way to level this flooring is so I can conform with building codes?\\nDoes this require a structural engineer (as has been suggested by a couple drafting professionals)? I thought it would just require additional concrete with some bonding agent...\\n(Updated 5/18/18) I had one architect+engineer tell me that the city is going to require the slab be replaced because it was not constructed with a moisture/vapor barrier under it. Does this sound right to anyone?\\nAnother suggestion made by someone who used to be in construction was to use 2x4's on their side to frame out a floor and shim up to level.

This remodel is very dated and disjointed and we are wanting to add a bathroom in this very large craft room, but it is on the other side of the house from the main bathrooms and the rest of the home was JUST refloored. Very near the remodeled area though is the outdoor clean out that then connects to the main house. It is close enough the cleanout couldn't be more than a foot top to bottom below the surface. As I am unsure where the waste lines are located I feel it would be more reasonable to tie in between the clean out and the rest of the plumbing (just outside of the house) and have a separate vent stack for the bathroom addition and washer.\\nWe currently have a concrete slab throughout and an ugly linoleum in the area for the bathroom addition.

Only our floor has real balconies, and the floor of each balcony is effectively the roof of part of the flat below. It's very solidly sealed/tanked. We have two such balconies, each on a corner of the building. Each has two downpipes from the gutters around the roof, and each downpipe feeds into an open drain. One of these drains is at the top of a slightly incline in the surface, and mostly only drains the gutters. The other is at the bottom of a slightly incline, and (in theory) drains the balcony as a whole, as well as another downpipe from the gutter.\\nOn both of the balconies, the latter drain has a plastic cover about 1cm thick, which looks like it was designed for a slightly bigger drain (the openings represent a bigger space than the drain does), but it works. On one, it is loose, but doesn't end up moving around, so this is fine. On the other, it has been stuck down.\\nAll the way around.\\nWith sealant of some sort, I think. At least, we think we can feel something around the bottom of it. There's no evidence of any sort of screw or fitting, and the two drain covers look identical.\\nSo on the balcony with the loose cover, the water running off the balcony itself can actually get 'under' it (not too efficiently, but it works), while on the balcony in which it is stuck down, the water only drains if it's over ~1cm deep. Then stops, unless we brush it so it is locally deep enough to go over that edge.\\nIs there any way we can safely, without damaging the weather-proof surface (which generally has decking tiles over it), un-stick that drain cover?\\n\",\n",

The probe works best sandwiched against the heat tape in the walls, with hysteresis set to 3°F. The heat tape heats untils it warms the probe that 3° more than the setting on the thermostat, then is off until 3° below the setting, and so on. In a short time the desired average temp is reached this way and maintained.\\nThe \"hot spot\" on the cage floor is just a bit warmer for various reasons and used by the animal for their thermal cycling: I put it there and maintain it and they choose how and when to use it. These animals aren\\'t always able to act for their own safety so I design a safety factor in. First, I try to not allow the floor they rest on to get too hot, but only have one probe for the thermostat, and it works better to keep the air at the design temp and try other methods for the floor. I keep floor heat reasonable by the amount and type of heat tape I use in proportion to the floor area and the overall temp desired. Experience helps. Second, I diffuse and distribute floor heat with ceramic  glazed-clay floor tiles. The adhesive used needs to attach the tiles directly to the enclosures\\' glass floors. The adhesive should be permanent and last for the life of the enclosure. It needs to expand and contract and maintain the bond. The tile and the glass may have different temps based on the current state of the heating cycle, described above, and environmental conditions in the area, such as a warm cage in a cold room. Last and not least, the adhesive needs to seal the joint between tile and glass floor so animal waste can be cleaned out effectively and completely.\\nThat\\'s a lot to ask of an adhesive. I\\'ve always used  \\'pure silicone\\', labeled as such. I wonder if anyone has a recommendation for any other material? Is there a particular silicone product (by type if asking for brands is not allowed), or is there a good flexible epoxy or polyurethane that might work with these materials and varying conditions? I know from experience that if the adhesive doesn\\'t flex enough the glass will break and possibly the tile too, or the joint may fail before the materials.  Thanks.\\n',\n",

Read the Wikipedia article on Sugru, learning they mix Silicone, talc and other ingredients... don\\'t inhale or light cigarettes while experimenting, right?\\nAnd there are a metric ton of Youtube videos like this one that go into detail about how to mix it.  But on that video you will see the application is for making molds, and he used various materials on the yet-to-be-solidified mixture, and after drying, pulled the objects off of it to show little to no adhesion onto those objects he is molding upon. For my purposes, I want initial moldability for a few minutes, but then \"stickability\" comparable for the original Sugru. Basically, I actually do want the resulting Oogoo to stick permanently to those objects I apply it to.\\nTo accomplish this, is this simply a matter of experimenting with the ratios of silicone rubber and corn-starch, or do I also need to add in those other ingredients such as talc etc to get the same/similar level of adhesion properties?\\nAnother way to say this: Is there a particular reason the Sugru makers chose talc over corn-starch, or is it simply a choice based upon their production costs?

I think nails themselves would be a solid repair, but the extra strength from some adhesive is also a good thing.\\nI've found that PL 400 (or other polyurethane) adhesive is advertised as compatible with wet pressure treated wood, and as being waterproof, and I'm leaning towards that.\\nThe deck is about 5 years old from what I understand, so the joists are certainly dry. I'm worried about using adhesive in the repair and having the shrinkage of the greener wood delaminate from the adhesive on one side of the wood. I'm also worried about the board drying unevenly with one side in contact with dry wood and the other in the open air, I think the wood may try and cup a bit, backing out my nails.

For my tile underlayment I chose hardibacker, and the appropriate hardi screws.  A youtube video series that I am using as my tutorial is not using hardibacker, but rather denshield.  In his tutorial, he uses liquid nails as a void-filler behind the denshield.  He stresses this is not a good idea for hardibacker or durock.\\nSo, while at my big-box home improvement store, I went looking for a construction adhesive that claimed to be compatible with hardibacker, and could not find one.  In fact, I found several that explicitly said not to use with cement backerboards.\\nAnd yet, the idea of a void-filler seems very important; my home builder did not see fit to use meticulously dimensioned lumber for my studs, so there are certain to be voids.\\nIs there some formulation or brand of construction adhesive that is known to bond well between hardibacker and pine?  If not, what should I use?\\nEDIT #1: I\\'d like to add that Hardie\\'s own tutorial video does not use a void filler, but also demonstrates on a wall that uses comically perfect studs.\\nEDIT #2: I think people may be confused by my question here, so I\\'m adding a picture to demonstrate.  The lumber shown behind the backerboard is sistered to the stud in the corner.  The sister was added by the original contractor to support the wallboard at this corner.  My spirit level shows the sister to be plumb, above the top of this backerboard.\\nAnd yet, you can see light from my flashlight shining between my straight-edge and the backerboard, over that sister.  This is because, at this particular location, the sister stands shy of the studs to the right of it.  Farther down the backer board, the sister lines up very well with the next stud, so no light shines through.  Since the sister seems to be plumb overall, I believe at this location it is slightly non-straight.  And that is why I am asking this question about void fillers.  Without a filler, when I run a screw in this corner, the backerboard will bend and I will no longer have a flat surface to set my tiles to.\\n(The size of the gap shown is about 1/16\".  As a consequence, my straight-edge will rock at that location.)\\n\"You are being too much of a perfectionist\" could be acceptable to me as an answer, so long as it is correct.  However, the advice I\\'ve heard is that flatness of the backer substrate is one of the most important details to ending up with good results for tile work.\\n\\n',\n",

Update the question so it\\'s on-topic for Home Improvement Stack Exchange.\\nClosed last year.\\nI live in a house with polished concrete radiant-heated floors. They\\'re not polished to a shine, but they do feel very smooth. I\\' d like to apply a decorative pattern to the floors with some sort of paint or tape.\\nThe first step would be to lay down something temporary, like masking tape, that can be easily moved or removed after a few days or weeks without leaving a permanent mark. I understand that many tapes can leave a residue, so I\\'m looking for a recommendation for a product that can be removed cleanly.\\nThe second step will be to replace the tape with a more durable tape or paint that will last a few years, and stand up to light foot traffic. (This will be inside a private home, and most foot traffic will be barefoot or in socks.) After several years, I will want to be able to remove it and restore the floors to their original condition. It\\'s ok if this takes several hours of focused cleaning, but it shouldn\\'t require re-polishing the floor, and I definitely don\\'t want to risk any dye soaking into the concrete, if that\\'s even possible.\\nAre there products that will reliably meet these criteria?\\nEDIT: according to a video on cleaning concrete floors, \"concrete is a reactive surface - you don\\'t want to put any acidic or highly alkaline [cleaning] products on the floor.\" I\\'m not sure if that helps narrow down the options - maybe an acid-free \"archival grade\" tape?\\n',\n",

              " 'https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/149904/reattach-quarter-round-molding-under-front-door': {'context': \"The quarter-round molding under my front door came off recently when I opened the door. The molding was attached to the doorsill with two different kinds of adhesive. Apparently the rubber weather strip under the door has been sweeping against the molding every time the door opens, and the adhesive finally gave out.\\n\\nI've used a chisel to remove the large pieces of adhesive that were on both the molding and the doorsill, intending to reattach the molding, but I'm not sure how best to reattach it. Here are some ideas I've had:\\nJust glue the molding to the doorsill again. My main concern is that the molding will just come off again due to the ongoing force of the weather strip sweeping against it. (The weather strip seems to apply quite a lot of force along the entire length of the molding, I've found by trying to hold the molding in place with my hands while opening the door.) Or maybe it would be fine; it seems like the original installers maybe didn't do an awesome job, as I saw big drops of glue that looked like they had adhered to only one of the two facing surfaces. Advice on what kind of glue or adhesive to use would be helpful.\\nTry screwing or nailing the molding to the doorsill. Maybe screws or nails would have better tensile strength than glue? However, I'm not sure what the doorsill is made of. It has a wood grain texture on the surface that feels maybe sort of fake and I don't know whether there's real wood on the inside. I'm not sure I can productively screw into it. I'm also worried about splitting or weakening the molding, and about the difficulty of drilling precisely into a round surface.\\nTry to sand down or otherwise somehow reduce the height of the molding such that the weather strip on the door clears it, so that the molding is no longer under tension when the door opens. It looks like I would have to remove several millimeters. I'm not sure how to go about doing this. Is there a particular power tool I would use for this?\\nBuy new quarter-round molding of smaller radius. This molding is 3⁄4′′ tall, so maybe I should replace it with 5⁄8′′ or 1⁄2′′ molding. It seems like it might be hard to find molding that matches the floor as perfectly as the existing molding, though.\\nI have no prior experience with this sort of thing but am interested to learn and would appreciate any advice on what approach to take.\\nEventually I noticed that the molding was not actually 3⁄4′′×3⁄4′′ as I had thought, but rather 3⁄4′′×5⁄8′′. When I flipped the molding around so that the 5⁄8′′ side was vertical and the 3⁄4′′ was horizontal—orienting the molding so that it was effectively shorter, just 5⁄8′′ tall—the door began clearing the molding easily and no longer exerted force on the molding with each opening. I simply attached the molding in this orientation with Liquid Nails Perfect Glue, which is the adhesive I had on hand, and it's had no problems since. Thanks to those who suggested solutions!\\n\",\n",

Since they are going to be outside the house and exposed to the elements, I've decided that a quality polyurethane glue is probably the best choice for gluing the boards together. I also want the shutters to be reasonably flat, so I've decide to clamp them from all four sides (the flat surfaces and sides). For the flat surfaces I'm planning on using 2 x 3 boards with carriage bolts on the ends. But what I don't want happening is for those boards to get glued to the shutter.I originally thought I could prevent that from happening by using wax paper or aluminum foil, but after reading about the properties of polyurethane glue, which will bond just about anything to anything, I'm not sure those are practical choices. I even thought maybe polyethylene garbage bags might be a viable choice. They would probably still get glued to the shutter but could be sanded off afterward and should prevent the polyurethane glue from penetrating to the wooden clamp.Is this a viable alternative, and does anyone have any better suggestions?\\n\",\n",

Apparently I missed one. So yes, I am a doof.\\nThe mistake: While installing a new granite vanity top and backsplash, the directions said \"do not use plumber\\'s putty\". It seems it should say \"do not use oil-based adhesives\" though I guess that is a moot point.\\nI had Liquid Nails LN-715 Tub Surround, which is vinyl acrylic base, and used a thin bead on the top of the cabinet, which did not bleed through. But I used more on the back of the back and side splash, and now a day later there are dark spots showing.\\nI have scanned internet discussions, and see many people giving advice and not many OPs coming back to report what worked or what didn\\'t. A lot of the advice is conflicting.\\nThe questions: Since this adhesive is not oil based, can I expect that these spots are capable of drying and disappearing on their own? If not, what can I do to remove or blend the stains? Condensation from my cup left a ring (which dried quickly), so I am sure it is unsealed.\\nI have granite cleaner and granite sealer, but am hesitant to apply anything until I know how to deal with the stains.\\nOptions I am considering: I see someone online had success blending his spots using a \"natural based stain\" but he gave no details on what he actually used.\\nAnother said to use a heater or blow dryer.\\nAnother said to apply a poultice. (Acetone? I think that was for regular LN)\\nAnother said I am screwed. (Probably also regular LN)\\nI expect the sealer would hinder any drying, and might equally darken the spots as much as the other parts leaving the spots still visible. Maybe not... looking for experienced advice on that.\\nThankfully, it is just the splashes, so replacing them is an option, though I would like it to be a last resort because I really don\\'t want to rip away the surface of the wall to remove them.

So I would apply the glue to one (or both?) piece of wood, wait 5 (or 10) min, then make contact and clamp.\\nBut from various Youtube videos it seems that the opentime is the same as working time.

Hope I didn\\'t mess up choosing this product given my application.\\nhttp://www.loctiteproducts.com/p/pss_seal_ap/directions/Loctite-2-in-1-Seal-&-Bond-All-Purpose.htm\\nOur 10+ year old vinyl floor (or linoleum) was glued down with a butt joint against the tub, except it is short/shy by about 1/16.  The old caulk is almost gone, and the flooring is peeling up a little bit, but lays back down flat with light pressure.\\nI bought an aluminum trim strip like the middle one here:\\n\\nexcept it\\'s not cove, instead it is a quarter-round profile, something like 3/16 or 1/4\" radius.\\nI passed it over my table saw to cut off the unwanted, leaving just the quarter round piece. It is tiny.\\nBecause it is water based and water-resistant, for better or worse I used the polyseamseal to \\'glue\\' it in place.  To keep it clamped in place while curing/drying, I used a half dozen 10\\' long springy wood sticks to the ceiling corner every 10\".\\nDid the work last night. Looks great today with almost no caulk exposed. Sticks are still in place.  But I\\'m wondering with little air exposure and only possible minimal exposure to the underlayment (possibly none if the vinyl adhesive was spread all the way to the tub), will it dry/cure? and how long will that take? How long should I leave the sticks in place?\\nIf I chose the wrong product, what product would have used?\\n',\n",

The instructions tells me to mix 2 parts water 1 part additive and use this solution as the water for the cement/sand mix to make a slurry to use between concrete and mortar on top. Or to make \"chapisco\" (it is cement and coarse sand very runny that is rolled or thrown on a surface to work like a scratch coat). But nowhere it says to use it as primer like the bonding agent.\\nNow I\\'m not sure if they are the same product and Brazil just uses for \"chapisco\" because this is the only thing that every brickworker does here or if they are completely different products.\\n',\n",

When the skirting was put in I had my carpenter cut me 2 pieces in preparation for the fireplace. I would love to improve my wood skills so a small project like this seems perfect (I have 2 fireplaces)\\n\\n\\nShould I just measure all the different lengths and try and draw it onto the skirting or should i scribe it on? I am unsure how would I scribe something onto a piece of wood that cannot be shortened on the left afterwards... Can you please explain?\\nWhat saw would you use to make the mains cuts? (I have a jigsaw, will that do?)\\nWhat saw would you use to cut around the gas pipe? would you make this a circle? a drill bit perhaps? how would i drill on the edge of a piece of wood without making a mess?\\nI assume I would use wood glue for the mitre cut, but What glue would you use to fix the skirting to the wall?\\nThanks so much for your help!\\n',\n",

It's like trying to put a screen protector on a phone, but harder, given the size.\\nAny tips for doing this?

By hand, with a squeegee, and aluminium rod. It doesn't have lettering or anything, it's just a simple sheet with backing that peels off to reveal the adhesive side.\\nI'm sure it needs practice, but pretty pointless if you're not using a good technique to start with.

My goal is to remove it and refinish the flooring beneath, much like has been done for the rest of the house.\\nThe old flooring is made up of a few layers. From top to bottom:\\nI began removing layers 1-4 and found that they were particularly easy to pull up around the perimeter of the room. Using a heavy-duty angled paint stripper and a hammer, I was able to pull everything up within the span of a few minutes.\\nThe middle section is another story however. It's hard to even get an edge under the wood squares. The construction and layering looks similar to that of the edges, though the edges may have had a different kind of adhesive for the 4th layer (it looks a little darker).\\nThis 4th layer material may be somewhat water soluble (with hot water at least), but it's hard to get the water underneath the wood-like layer. I've tried flooding the wood layer with hot water but it isn't particular effective.\\nThe flooring was installed in 1949, which is a little before asbestos was heavily used. There's still a reasonable chance of it existing in the vinyl tiles and the first layer of mastic (layer 2) so precautions are being taken (approved respirator, eye protection, disposable clothing, dampening of everything to keep the dust level down, proper disposal of materials, etc). That being said, I consider sanding to be out of the question at this point, though the top vinyl layer and mastic could be fairly easily removed first if need be.\\nHow might I more effectively remove this flooring?\\nUpdate\\nI'm beginning to think that the 4th layer might actually be extremely old vinyl tiles, meaning that the mastic between them and the wood flooring is what's tripping me up.\\n\\n\",\n",

After a few winters of waking up to the feeling of the roof slope sucking the warmth out of me, I got a pack of polystyrol inner wall insulation. Unlike traditional styrofoam, it is a homogenous foam on the inside, similar to polyurethane foam. On the outside, it has a matte finish with a very fine paint-like structure.\\nI nailed the plates to the wall, right over the existing structured wallpaper. Then I filled the seams and the nail heads with acrylic caulk. Now I'd like to give it a finished look.\\nI feel adventurous enough to try a wallpaper. I have never applied wallpaper before, but it seems that the new cellulose-fleece-backed type is very easy to work with.\\nThe problem is that the Internet tells me that regular wallpaper glue won't stick to regular styrofoam. I didn't find information specific to the glue for cellulose-backed wallpaper, or about this finished styrofoam. I also found the information that wallpaper can be applied to styrofoam in the following order:\\nThis information came from the site of Henkel, manufacturers of styrofoam glue which costs 7 Euros per kg, an amount which only suffices for 1-2 square meters of wall.\\nBefore I pay for glue two times as expensive as the styrofoam below it and three times as expensive as the wallpaper above it, I'd like to know:\\nThis is what the caulked styrofoam looks like right now:\\n\\n\",\n",

The instructions say \"open time up to 20 minutes\" and \"install hardwood while the glue is still fresh, do not allow it to skin-over\". I do realize that underlayment material is non-porous and installation method may differ from hardwood flooring, but since there were no specific instructions, I proceeded according to the instructions on the can of glue. I probably gave it 10 minutes of open time before I rolled underlayment on top of freshly applied glue. There was a lot of trapped air that caused bubbles. I pierced them and pressed the air out. Next morning I was ready to install the floor, but I noticed the glue under the underlayment is still fresh. It cured around the edges, but it is completely fresh otherwise. What did I do wrong? What are my options now?\\nUpdate: The underlayment was installed on Wednesday. Sunday night I checked, and there are still some pockets of uncured glue. I am worried that the glue might never set at all. Still looking for a solution.\\n\\n',\n",

Said curtain tends to wave around while I am in the shower, clinging to my legs and letting water flow outside.\\nMy best idea for a low-cost solution was to sew some Velcro strips to the (textile) curtain. This worked well, until I tried to fasten the hooky strips to the wall. It turns out that none of the glues and double-sided tapes I have at home are strong enough. When I pull on the Velcro, the hooky strip comes off the wall and stays hooked to the fluffy strip on the curtain.\\nAny ideas for low-cost, non-invasive methods of getting the strips to stick to the wall? I assume that I need a stronger glue - what should I look for? Or is it a fool's errand? I am renting this apartment - I can't drill holes and screw something glue-friendly under the Velcro.\\nThe wall is covered with glazed porcelain tile.\\n\",\n",

The door and deflector are both wooden.  The deflector was stuck on, not screwed.  I'm not quite sure what the joining material I can see is: some kind of putty to hold it on I think, and white silicone sealant in a hidden channel near the top.\\n\\n\\nI tried bodging a fix using a glue gun (this is the transparent material in the pictures).  Once it was in place, I put a bead of glue along the top of the deflector, because I'm worried about water getting into the gap between the deflector and door, being held there and causing the wood to rot.  My bodge didn't last long, however: the deflector fell off again after a few weeks.\\nWhat's the best way to reattach the deflector?  I'm thinking about screwing it into place this time, and spreading some silicone sealant along the top portion (including the hidden channel) to stop water getting in the gap.  I have no experience with silicone sealant, though.  When that's complete, I guess I need to repaint it all, which the door needs anyway...\\n\",\n",

I know that I can reinforce the existing joists by sistering new joists to them, but I'm curious - is there any reason a carefully installed and glued patch wouldn't do the same trick?  It's been my experience that wood glue is stronger than the wood grain around the joint - at least as far as shear values are concerned.

I would like to glue the poster to this frame, and hang the frame on the wall.\\nMy question is what sort of glue to use that will bond the surface of the laminate (without damaging it) to the wood. I don\\'t know what kind of plastic the laminate is made from.\\nUPDATE\\nHere is a picture of the frame overlaid on the poster (map). Obviously I plan to attach it to the rear :-)\\n\\n',\n",

The burner grates appear to be painted cast-iron, while the surface below them is a polished and painted metal of some sort.  To protect the lower surface from damage, the grates have several tiny feet.  I'm not sure if the feet are rubber or plastic; they have a texture which is kinda half-way between.\\nOne of these feet has now fallen out.  It has a quarter-inch diameter rod piece, which fits into a hole in the cast-iron.  It doesn't look like anything broke (no residue from tabs on the back end of the foot) but it now freely comes out and won't stay.  So, I'm looking for ways to re-attach the foot.  I'm thinking maybe some form of high-heat industrial glue, which will bond to cast-iron and plastic.  Food safe would probably be a plus; not that it's in contact with food but if the glue gave off fumes when exposed to heat that would be bad.  Are there any glues which meet all these requirements?\\nUPDATE\\nI finally managed to talk to Frigidaire about this, and thought I'd update with the info they gave me in case anyone wants it in the future.\\nThey do sell an adhesive for this; it's terribly expensive.  Also, these rubber feet things are not covered by warranty, which may explain why not many other people discuss this; it's a part that's expected to fail, and people just ignore it.  Personally, I kinda like my stove top level and un-scratched.\\nSimilar to @Steven, they recommended a high-heat glue.  When I asked about heat requirements, they suggested shopping in automotive supply stores for glues suitable for car engines.  So I'm off to see how those compare.\\n\",\n",

I'll spare all the ugly details except the one that's relevant to this question which is the fact that a few parts of the vinyl don't appear to have been glued to the floor. In one spot, there is an area measuring at about two feet in diameter where the floor is lifted up like a bubble and can be pressed down. It doesn't do this across the entire floor which tells me that the adhesive application was effective beneath most of the floor.\\nIt's obvious that the vinyl is going to have to be torn up so that adhesive can be properly applied to areas where the application was faulty. First off, won't tearing the vinyl from the adhesive damage or misshape the vinyl? Won't applying additional adhesive potentially cause the floor to be lumpy and uneven in spots?\\nI am asking in the event that this company tells me they will just pull up the existing vinyl to apply new adhesive instead of redoing the entire floor (underlayment, adhesive, and vinyl). I just want to be prepared with a few counter-arguments should they try to get cheap with with me.\\n\",\n",

Update the question so it\\'s on-topic for Home Improvement Stack Exchange.\\nClosed 7 years ago.\\nMy girlfriend bought a cheap-but-chic watch (a Peugeot 705) that she likes a lot.  Unfortunately, the crystal wasn\\'t glued in place very well, and she suddenly noticed that the hands and face were exposed.  We found the crystal, and I used my old standby: SuperGlue.  Bad, bad idea!\\nTake a fool\\'s advice, by the way: you don\\'t want to use CA glue in a visible/transparent setting where the vapor can\\'t escape as it cures.  I didn\\'t make the connection, but this is how they \"raise\" latent prints on all those police-procedural TV shows.  Basically, the inside of the crystal is now coated in an acrylic fog, with a partial thumbprint in the top right.  There\\'s a fairly clear area in the center, through which I can see that the watch is still running and actually keeping good time.\\nSo now I want to take the crystal back off so I can clean it... but since SuperGlue is fairly tough stuff, I\\'m having difficulties.  I used an X-Acto knife to scrape out the excess from the outside groove, and I\\'ve (sparingly) used acetone-based nail polish remover in that groove... but the crystal remains firmly in place.\\nThe watch body is stainless steel, so it\\'s fairly tough; the crystal is... uh, crystal?  I don\\'t know, really.  Not acrylic, anyway.  My main concern is damaging the works and/or the face.\\nThe watch itself probably cost $50 or less, so it\\'s mostly pride on the line, not money...  that and domestic tranquility, which is priceless.\\n',\n",

Previous owners did some bad renovations by themselves. I noticed lots of bugs coming in. Figured out the wooden kitchen/garage adjustable door threshold was screwed down all the way. Got down there to raise it and realized when they did kitchen tile, they mortared against the threshold, in it's tightened down position. The grout line is about 1/4 inch wide, all along the threshold.\\nThen they filled the adjustable screw head with grout so nobody could adjust it up and break the grout line/threshold connection. Except the screw closest to hinge, it doesn't have grout in it, and it's raised flush against the door bottom like it's supposed to be. Then the other three are all tightened down.\\nI don't know if you're supposed to tile flush to the threshold edge or grouting to the edge is better, if they did it wrong or not.\\nI tried scratching the screw head grout with a screwdriver and a dental tool but nothing came off. Any ideas for that, short of demolishing it to get it out?\\nWould using a dremel and thin cutting wheel break the grout cleanly along threshold? Or will it break up the 1/4 channel and I'll have to re-grout that part, hoping to match the color? I've never grouted before and don't really want to get into it. I'm terrible at painting and caulking so probably won't do well with grouting.\\nOr any other ideas? Thanks!\\n\",\n",

This is a plug-on-neutral panel. I believe per NEC2017, one is supposed to upgrade all 20AMP or smaller breakers to either GFCI or AFCI (I'm replacing with a combo GFCI/AFCI) when upgrading to a new panel.\\nOne AC/BX cable in-particular (purple circle) which has two 14ga hots and one 14ga (shared) neutral is giving me pause.  Back in the day someone went and wired separate circuits onto the separate hots.  Each hot serves 3 non-grounded regular 15amp outlets, 2 switched 15amp outlets that were used for lamps, and one has an actual hallway light switch.\\nI originally put each hot to a separate 15amp GFCI/AFCI breaker (blue oval) and tried to throw the one neutral onto the neutral bar (white circle).  This doesn't seem to work (circuits on those two hots are dead). I believe this is because there is no continuity between the hots and the neutral, as with the new GFCI/AFCI plug-on-neutral breakers, the neutral is supposed to go on the breaker.  Does that sound right? I can't exactly put the one neutral onto one of the GFCI/AFCI breakers, that just doesn't seem right.\\nShould I use non-GFCI/AFCI breakers (which was the case before and the two circuits worked)? If so, I would hope that the inspector would allow for this exception to requiring the GFCI/AFCI breakers, as I'm not changing anything on the circuits, just connecting them to a new panel.\\n\",\n",

However, each existing neutral is wired into each lug-hole with a ground, all other breakers in the box are standard, non AFCI.\\nWhen I test with it hooked up and turn the light switch on (with only 4 LEDs connected, for now), it trips right away.

The panel actually looks really well done inside, no corrosion either.  Note this is not a sub-panel, it's the one and only.\\nHere is the breaker:\\nAll is well if I leave the pigtail disconnected, the breaker stays on, but the test functions do not work and it will probably not pass an inspection, which I require for our permit.

First thing I did was go to the panel and, tediously, went through each breaker to make a detailed master breaker list. After doing so I noticed that my outside receptacle and bathrooms (2 full, 2 half) receptacles were not GFCI protected (all on the same circuit). Went and got an AFCI breaker (15A) and replaced the common breaker at the panel. A couple days ago I noticed I had lost power to these outlets. Checked the breaker and it wasn't tripped. Reset it anyways. I get 120 at the breaker but nowhere else in the circuit. I don't know which receptacle is the first in line (I have an educated guess that first in line is basement half bath, then main floor half bath, after it's either guest full and master full, then last is outside receptacle. Purely based on number of lines coming in and out of each receptacle). I tried to test for continuity from panel to receptacles but I'm not getting anything. Was wondering if anyone had some additional advice/troubleshooting or if I should write it off as bad wiring from panel to first receptacle?\\nOk, replaced AFCI with old breaker, still no power at outlets. I'm chasing down continuity to see the wiring path and I ran into a block. My guest bathroom has two sets of wires (no continuity to anything I can find) and my downstairs bathroom has two sets (one set traced to main floor bathroom) I uploaded a picture of my wire chasing (extremely simplistic. Br=breaker, Bb=basement bathroom, MB=Main floor bathroom, MsB=Master bath, GB=Guest bath, FO=Front outside, BO=Back outside).\\nI've come to the conclusion that I've lost two receptacles, or the wiring from breaker to guest and from guest to downstairs is fried and needs replaced. Any suggestions from the community?\\n\\n\",\n",

This is a 2016 built building.\\nHowever, over the past three days I've had my breaker trip once every evening, usually when turning on a light switch on a completely different breaker. Here's a pic of the breaker. The manual I pulled up for this series of breakers suggests that an LED can indicate the last fault cause, but there's no illumination from the box, and instead I always get this orange trip flag:\\n\\nNow, we have a couple of clues here. This appears to be an AFCI, or maybe DFCI, breaker. The fact that this is tripping when a light switch is flipped on another breaker makes me think the neutrals are connected to each other somewhere. There's a lot of interesting stuff on the circuit that trips, like a server rack with a UPS and some LED lights. However, none of the equipment there has changed recently, and if I pull my UPS logs, I'm drawing about 400W at full load, or about 3A. There's other things not going through the UPS, like some monitors and laptop chargers, but this is a 20A breaker and should have plenty of overhead to draw multiple times that and still sit under the 16A-at-load rule of thumb.\\nAt first, I was content to blame the fact that I have an awful CFL + dimmer switch setup installed in the living room (not by my choice), and the fact I had been using the dimmer recently. My reading into AFCI suggests that CFLs, dimmers, and crossed neutrals can have an effect like this.\\nHowever, today the breaker was tripped with these lights on max, which is a condition I've had them in for the last several months.\\nI'm scratching my head at this one, and since we're in shelter-in-place out in California, I'm puzzling over the next steps before I call my landlord.\\nSome questions overall: 1. Any guesses about why this would happen when turning on lights in the other room, on a different circuit? Is my AFCI + combined neutrals theory correct? 2. Any guesses about why this would happen now, but wouldn't have for the last 6 months? 3. Is the breaker indicating any sort of information about the fault cause, or am I left guessing whether this is AFCI, GFCI, or overload caused?\\nAppreciate any suggestions you may have!\\n\",\n",

The only thing on this circuit is the AFCI receptacle and 1 additional receptacle, running off the load side of the AFCI.  No issue's until about a week ago.  Then one morning, no power.  I unplugged everything and tried resetting the receptacle, but it tripped.  At that point, not being used to AFCI I forgot to check whether that was a GFCI or AFCI trip?

I had by accident tied the neutral from that set in with the neutrals in the box for the lower level. When I went to turn the garage breaker on, it tripped immediately. I then figured out my mistake and removed the garage-circuit neutral from the lower level bundle. I could now turn on the garage breaker. But when I try to turn on the lower level breaker, it trips right away.\\nI went through the steps for the QO time saver diagnostics and it trips at 0 seconds, indicating one of the following:\\nMy plan now, instead of removing all my switches, I would start in the middle of the run, disconnect a set of load wires, and see if it still trips, indicating which half of the circuit the problem is, and continuing like that, inspecting all my previous work.

In the bathroom there 3 light switches, labeled 1,2 & 3 on image, switch 1 directs to a pot light and an led light, switch 2 goes to a vanity light and 3 is a fan.\\nFor months we haven't been able to use switch 1 because it will trip the breaker, not always immediately, but usually within 30 seconds. I spent all week trying to solve it, I went into the device box and cleaned up the wires for the switches as best I could making sure nothing was exposed, I replaced the switch (from another one in the basement so I knew it worked). This all improved the issue slightly, in that it took a while longer to trip.\\nWe kept thinking we had solved it and then short time later it would trip again, here is where it gets weird... we discovered an almost surefire way to make it trip was to have both light switches on (1 & 2) and then turn off switch 2 (ie the one that hasn't been a problem); switch 2 being turned off would kill the breaker as long as switch 1 was on. I pulled out all the lights tested different combination of wiring, such as one light being bypassed or cut off and this more or less holds true. Except now I find it takes the light a few minutes to heat up or whatever before turning off 2, while 1 is on, will trip the breaker.\\nAnyways there is not a lot of load on the circuit, a tv and SMALL deepfreeze and two lights that are rarely on (pantry).\\nAlso I could just swap out the afci break for a regular since the inspector has come and gone\\nLED Used https://www.homedepot.ca/product/illume-4-inch-led-recessed-led-panel-light-with-integrated-3000k-4000k-or-5000k-options-in-satin-nickel-finish-energy-star-/1001063503\\n\",\n",

Outlets & switches both. The biggest concern is our new LG refrigerator. It trips about once a week, sometimes even more.  Called the city inspector who said AFCI was now code. Ok, so how do we fix this tripping problem? With the lights it's not that big a problem but the refrigerator is another story. We can't go away even for a few days cause the fridge will probably go out. I put a corded light on top of the fridge, plugged into the same outlet as fridge, 15 amp service AFCI, when that light goes out I know it's time to go down into the basement to reset the breaker, dedicated also. So what is the answer? The electrician who wired the house refuses to come back to change or check his work. The neighbor said his paper shredder tripped a fault. A clicker switch to turn lights on & off from a chair tripped the AFCI breaker. It can be anything. If the NEC is going to make these changes, why not put the breaker on the first floor? But my original question is, why is the refrigerator tripping every 3/6 days, randomly.\\n\",\n",

On the service entrance, there's a Siemens whole-house surge protector. The service enters the workshop where it splits up in a large junction box. One part goes to the load center breaker box for the garage/workshop, which has a 100A main breaker. The other part goes through PVC conduit under ground to the load center breaker box for the house, which has a 200A main breaker. The grounding system for the house/garage/workshop combo includes nine 10-foot copper-clad ground rods connected to each other (in a loop around the buildings) by 300 feet of buried 1/0 AWG bare copper wire, and connected to the service entrance with 1/0 AWG bare copper wire.\\n(It's perhaps worth noting here that the electrical inspector, when passing our electrical for final, told me it was one of the best-wired and best-grounded houses he had ever seen. There's no shoddy work on which to place blame for this weird issue.)\\nThe house's load center is primarily filled with combination AFCI+GFCI circuit breakers. The water heater in the house is a gas tankless and hasn't given us any problems.\\nThe garage/workshop is primarily GFCI breakers (no AFCI or AFCI+GFCI breakers). There's a small mud room in the workshop serviced by a small 56-amp 240-volt (no neutral, just two legs and a ground) electric tankless water heater on a 60-amp circuit.\\nSometimes, and not every time mind you, or even most of the time, but sometimes, when I turn on the sink or shower in the workshop mudroom (thus activating the electric tankless water heater), two combo AFCI+GFCI breakers in the house (a separate building, remember) trip. It's always the same two breakers: The circuit for the server/equipment rack in the basement and the circuit for the bedroom receptacles. It's never any other circuits in the house that trip, and it's never any of the circuits in the garage that trip.\\nIt might be worth noting that the circuit for the server/equipment rack has a very large power conditioner / surge protector / battery backup system on it, and the bedroom circuit has surge-protection-built-in receptacles. However, these aren't the only circuits in the house (or even the garage) with surge protection. The (AFCI+GFCI) circuit for the entertainment center in the living room has a surge-protection-built-in receptacle and a battery backup but never trips, and a (GFCI) circuit in the garage/workshop building has a surge protector / battery backup plugged into it and never trips.\\nI'm at a loss to explain how turning on a tankless water heater in one building can trip (the same two) AFCI+GFCI breakers in another building. Anyone have any thoughts?\\n\",\n",

New summary of the problem:\\nIt\\'s a Siemens Type QAF 20 amp breaker, 2006-built home - the circuit has been labeled \"beth plugs.\" We isolated the outlets that this controls, and they are several 2nd-Floor outlets as well as our TV/Cable box outlet on Floor 1.\\nThere have been no trip incidents for the 3 years we\\'ve been here, and we have not added any new draws to that circuit.\\nThe first time it tripped was Monday. We were watching TV while installers were putting radiant barrier up in the attic. They said they hadn\\'t plugged anything in.\\nWhen this breaker tripped, I found that the GFCI outlet on the counter in the kitchen had also tripped. It is on its own separate \"kitchen plugs\" circuit, however, I was unable to reset the tripped \"beth plugs\" breaker until I reset the GFCI outlet in the kitchen.\\nThis kitchen GFCI outlet and its associates are on the other side of the wall from the downstairs TV outlet controlled by the tripped AFCI breaker. It appears that both are served by wires dropped down inside that wall from 2nd floor crawl space.\\nYesterday, my wife was at home watching TV (installers/equipment gone as job was finished Monday) and it happened again. Same outlet tripped in kitchen, same breaker tripped in garage.\\nWhat could be going on here? With no new equipment adding draw and the GFCI tripping as well? Some have suggested faulty GFCI receptacle tripping the nearby AFCI breaker, even though they aren\\'t same circuit. Others have suggested faulty breaker. And others have said installers probably messed up a connection somewhere. Any clues?\\nI can\\'t make the breaker trip for experimentation, which makes it very difficult to investigate. We went through the house using one of those wiring testers and all showed as good.\\nThanks for any help at all.\\n',\n",

We live in a 1950s home. An electrician recommended I replace the old breakers on ungrounded circuits off the house sub-panel with combination GFCI/AFCI breakers. Here are the ones I've purchased: http://w3.usa.siemens.com/powerdistribution/us/en/product-portfolio/circuit-breakers/residential-circuit-breakers/Pages/Dual-Function.aspx. We have a mix of 15A and 20A breakers.\\nGenerally, I haven't had any issues replacing the breakers. I've done several and they all work as expected. However, one breaker slot on the sub-panel is behaving strangely. The slot works as expected with the old breaker. But when replacing the old breaker with the new GFCI breaker, it won't flip into the ON position. It seems that nothing is wrong with the new breaker itself: two new breakers of the same type exhibit the same behavior in that slot, but work as expected in another slot. The instructions that come with the new breaker suggest this issue happens when no power is getting to it, but that doesn't make sense to me since the old breaker works fine in that position.\\nTo be clear, the new breaker doesn't appear to be tripping. It never is able to switch on to begin with.\\nDoes this ring any bells? Any troubleshooting tips appreciated.\\nEDIT: I was using Seimans Breakers when I should have been using GE Breakers approved for use in my particular panel. After replacing with the correct type of breakers, everything works as expected in all the original positions.\\n\",\n",

I don't know how, I must have overlooked it, but best I can tell, the information (in a very clear format) isn't out there.  So could someone please help me out here?  (sorry for the preface, I'm used to being accused of not doing research/making duplicate questions so I wanted to, more or less, show the steps I took before I decided to ask a question here).\\nAFCI breakers are significantly more expensive than AFCI receptacles.  (Scratch that, it's the GFCI breakers that are significantly more expensive than the receptacles...well regardless, I'm still curious about this and it would be good to know!) and I had the idea of installing an AFCI blank face outlet (which, I can't imagine what other use a blank face outlet would have honestly) right beside the breaker box before heading out to the circuit so that the entire circuit would be protected.\\nSomething like this: https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-20-Amp-SmartlockPro-Arc-Fault-Circuit-Interrupter-AFCI-Blank-Face-Outlet-White-AFRBF-W/301767741\\nMy idea was to buy a metal multi-gang box (or more) and mount them beside the breaker box, then run conduit to them (short runs) and have the circuit go through these boxes which will have blank face AFCI receptacles (one per each circuit)\\nThe only crystal clear piece of information that I have though is that from the box, to the first receptacle, it must be armor clad cabling, or in metal conduit and the first box must be metal and grounded.  This is where I get confused though because I've seen a couple of people state that every single box downstream of the AFCI receptacle must be metal also.  I've seen that specifically mentioned, but I've also seen it omitted (only mentioning conduit to the first box and the first box being metal).  Considering the entire reason for an AFCI in the first place, it makes sense that they require armor clad cabling or conduit up to the first AFCI protected receptacle, as well as that box being required to be metal.  But I don't understand why every box downstream must be metal too since, for all intents and purposes, this receptacle would be acting exactly like an AFCI breaker, which I don't believe I've seen anybody say that device boxes and junction boxes must be metal on an AFCI breaker protected circuit.\\nI didn't see anything in the NEC code book though, that was very clear that all receptacles downstream must be in a metal box, but the way they word things can be a little confusing so I could have misread/misunderstood.  So I'm wondering if maybe somebody just made that assumption and said that but it's not actually required?\\nMy concern is not about being code compliant, but rather safety.  Obviously I must be at least code compliant, but it's like it was stressed when I was driving a truck over the road;  Be SAFE and legal.  Safety ALWAYS comes before being legal.\\nThank you kindly for your help!\\n\",\n",

The house was built in 1968, has a 100A service and a Square D breakers panel. Currently there are no AFCIs anywhere in the house, and the only GFCIs are in the kitchen and bathrooms. All electricity works fine with the regular breakers.\\nUpstairs has 4 bedroom and 2 bathrooms. All of these are supplied from two circuits - #4 and #6. The stairs light is supplied from circuit #2, with a 3-way switch at the top and bottom of the stairs.\\nWhen installing AFCI breakers on these circuits, the following trips occur:\\nTesting with a double pole AFCI breaker behaves as follows:\\nIn all cases the AFCI \"diagnostic\" trip immediately, which can mean arching to ground, grounded neutral, ground fault or shared neutral.\\nI know for sure there is a shared neutral between #2 and #6 - the 3-way switch for the stairs light (fed from circuit #2) runs 2 wires from the bottom switch to the top switch (using the white wire for the traveler) and the stairs light fixture uses the #6 circuit neutral. The #2 circuit neutral is floating in the bottom 3-way switch junction box.\\nThere might be more sharing of neutrals, but I haven\\'t found any yet.\\nWhat might lead to 3 breakers affecting each other with AFCI? How can I diagnose this further?\\nEdit:\\nHere is a picture of the panel as it is now. The three breakers marked with the red box are the breakers in question (#2, #4 and #6). The AFCI breaker at the bottom left is for the basement lights, which I have rewired from scratch. This AFCI works fine, so I assume that the panel is okay.\\n\\nEdit 2:\\nI did some troubleshooting. Turns out circuits #4 and #6 seem to partially share a neutral in the same way as #2 and #6 - both cases are 3-way switches that use a 14/2 to connect the two switches, using the white as the traveler and taking a neutral where possible.\\nAfter disconnecting the two offending neutral crossovers (temporary solution before routing proper 14/3 between the 3-way switches), the AFCI situation improves:\\nHere\\'re some pictures of the offending junction boxes. Note the floating neutral in the switches:   And the cut off phase (circled black wire):\\nEdit 3:\\nTurns out the AFCI trip on #6 was due to a grounded neutral in one of the outlets I replaced. The AFCI \"time saving\" diagnostic should have exposed this via an instant trip in diagnostic mode, but that didn\\'t happen. Now both #4 and #6 work correctly on AFCI breakers.\\nTrying some things with the 3-way circuits didn\\'t seem to make any sense, with various combinations of neutral/live connections causing different breakers to trip (sometimes both #4 and #6, sometimes only #6). I will just redo the entire wiring in the 3-way circuits with proper 14/3.\\n',\n",

One of them kept tripping immediately, so I tracked down the problem to where a neutral and ground were joined. (There was just the one neutral in that box.) To confirm that this was the problem, I disconnected the neutral from the ground and ran a neutral wire to another nearby box in the same circuit and connected it to neutral there.  Problem solved!\\nAlmost.\\nIt looks like the above. The outlet (O) on the left is fed into from earlier in the circuit. It connects to the right, which connects up to a 3-way switch (S3), which connects left to the other 3-way switch, which then feeds a regular switch (S) to a light (L) (independent of the 3-ways). S3 on the right has an isolated neutral from O that is capped off. S3 on the left therefore has no neutral to contribute to the S and L part, so they just tied the neutral there to the ground, which was my problem.\\nTo test this, I ran a neutral between the left 3-way switch and outlet, joining their neutrals. That's what worked. But when I ran the 12-2, I also joined their grounds, and that caused the AFCI/GFCI to trip immediately when I turned it on. (Actually, with a half-second delay -- it tripped immediately if there was any load on the circuit.) And if I disconnect those grounds it works again.\\nSo there's my question: why would having an extra ground there be the difference between AFCI/GFCI tripping or not tripping?\\nThe bottom receptacles are all on that circuit, too, but always hot (not switched).\\nIt's all working, so this isn't urgent, but I'm baffled and would like to know what's going on!\\nThanks.\\n\",\n",

Since then, around 7 out of 10 spin cycles it trips the breaker, we reset it and go on our way.  Some spin cycles it takes 5-6 times for us to reset the breaker before the washer will actually finish.\\nWe had a tech come out yesterday 2/15/17, and couldn't find anything wrong with the washer.  He called Samsung and they told him we need to switch the breaker from a Square D to a Siemens or a GE breaker.  My fiancé was home, and I wasn't, she passed on that samgsung said it had to do with the digital read out from the washer and it works with the other breaker brands.  After doing some research, it seems that many people have issues with either AFCIs or GFCI breakers.\\nI can buy a  square D AFCI breaker only.  Any suggestions if that is worth a try?  The other brand breakers GE or Siemens aren't the same shape, they are much shorter, so I'm not sure how well they will mount in the box.

But they could not find the root of the problem and they will come again in one week but I wanted to ask here for suggestions that maybe can help to that persons and avoid mistakes an check they make according the latest NEC.\\nWith regular circuits there is no problem at all. Everything is working perfectly. Then what about they tested here are my questions:\\n1.-For example they replaced the kitchen circuit breaker to AFCI but making tests that persons they found that if you turn on any light or connect anything  in any outlet and you turn on, then the foyer trips the new kitchen AFCI. The AFCI does not trip unless you turn on anything on foyer. 2.-They made the opposite test. Connect the AFCI to the foyer and a regular circuit breaker in the kitchen and the same if you turn on anything in the kitchen then that trips now the foyer. 3.-The same between the dinning room and the garage lights. After put any AFCI circuit breaker on any circuit then the regular circuit will trip the AFCI. Like point 1 but now between garage and dining room. 4.-About the living room is more complex maybe because if they connect an AFCI circuit breaker in living room it trips always it never turns on. They disconnected all neutrals from main box panel and also they switched off all breakers at home leaving just on the living rooms and it trips. In point 1,2 and 3 the AFCI turns on and give power to the correspondent section of the home and trips only when you turn on any light or anything in the section of the regular circuit breaker but here in point 4 in living room is different because the AFCI trips since the beginning and including like I mentioned before they switched off each breaker and dissconected all neutrals on the main box in other word all the home without electricity except the living room AFCI circuit and it trips always.\\nWhat could be the root of the problems? For example in point 1,2 and 3 could be a shared neutral problem? They made a suggestion that maybe this could be the problem and maybe this could be solved with a siemens q220afc 2 pole AFCI circuit breaker to use with shared neutrals or what I need to inspect or suggest to that persons now they come to check?\\nIn point 4 is strange because it trips always and including being the only circuit alive in the test.\\nI hope someone can help to give me tips here to have knowledge and supervise these persons do the right thing.\\nThank you\\n',\n",

I found that by shutting off the 40amp to the garage feed in the main panel, the AC unit and basement breakers were no longer tripping.  Coincidence?  Could the 40amp breaker be bad and causing issues within the main panel?  Or would it be more beneficial to start looking at the garage circuits themselves?

Sometime between then and the next time I go to start the dishwasher (typically 2 days), the circuit trips.\\nThe dishwasher has a switch under the sink.  I\\'ve tried turning the switch off just after the cycle completes and I\\'ve verified that the power is still on.  Next time I go to start it I turn on the switch and the circuit is off.  So I don\\'t think the dishwasher is doing anything to cause this.\\nThe breaker that trips is labeled \"Disposal\".  The \"Dishwasher\" one is next to it and stays on.  The disposal has always had power.  The dishwasher circuit does not appear to trip related to when the disposal is run.  Not sure if this is a simple mislabel or a sign of something more sinister.\\nLast note and this may be completely unrelated or might not.  After a few months of running just fine, the fridge in my utility room started to trip the breaker daily, then getting more often and eventually tripping it every few hours.  It is also on a GFCI/AFCI combo circuit.  I plugged it into another circuit which had an AFCI-only breaker and it was fine.  After reading about the 2015 regulation changes and how many people were having trouble, I replaced the G/A combo breaker with an AFCI-only and it has run fine ever since.  A few weeks after this the dishwasher trouble started.\\nI\\'m stumped.  Before I start disconnecting things, monitoring currents, etc, does anyone have ideas as to why this could be happening?  The house is under warranty for another few months but I\\'m just not the type to call them in without some idea of whats wrong.\\nThe breaker that trips is an Eaton type that has the diagnostic LED.

All the major load center manufacturers seem to be making these now. The idea is to provide a neutral bar at a fixed distance on each side of the bus bars, so specially-designed AFCI or GFCI breakers can plug directly onto the bus bar and the neutral bar without requiring a pigtail connection. Here\\'s a picture from a catalog:\\n\\nThe extra-long breakers in the middle are the AFCI ones which snap directly onto the neutral bar. Very clever!\\nBut I\\'m confused about how this panel could be configured as a subpanel. In the picture the two neutral bars are clearly connected (somehow, where is the bonding strap?) and they are connecting both neutrals and grounds to both. In a subpanel, the neutrals and grounds must be separated.\\nDoes this mean one of those bars must be separated from the neutral somehow, in which case the fancy plug-on breakers would be limited to one side of the panel? Or can they both be isolated and a separate ground bar installed (how?)\\nIt seems like it would be a waste if only one side could take advantage of the plug-on AFCI/GFCI, since almost every room requires one or the other now.\\n',\n",

I'm doing a remodel which involves adding a new guest room which shares a wall with the kitchen.   I remodeled the kitchen a few years ago, so I have a good handle on the wiring there (like seven circuits -- two for small appliances, lighting, dishwasher, disposal, microwave, and one more circuit for miscellany like the fridge, range hood, gas range outlet,  the light in the adjacent laundry).    I ran all new wires for everything, except for the miscellaneous circuit, I used a 12/2 cable from the 80s which looked perfectly good.   Everything has been fine for 5 years.\\nNow I decide to use the circuit also for the outlets and lights in my new guest room.  Everything is wired up, and everything works great.   But then in preparing for the inspection I went and bought an AFCI since they will require it for that circuit. AFCI trips.   Crap.\\nStart debugging.   Disconnect all the new wiring  -- still trips. Unplug fridge -- still trips.   Unplug range -- still trips. Disconnect range hood -- still trips. Disconnect all the wires at the first outlet.   As far as I know, it is a straight shot for the panel to this outlet.   So maybe there really is arcing in the main line from the panel.   But it does not trip.   OK, I'm feeling pretty good at this point because I can add the downstream wiring one at a time. Reconnect the range hood (without the hood on) -- doesn't trip. Reconnect the laundry lights and new wirings -- doesn't trip!   That is all the downstream wiring!\\nThen I switched on the laundry lights -- trips -- just the lights, maybe 50W. Turn lights off, plug in fridge -- trips.\\nBasically, I'm forced to conclude that something about the wiring is causing the AFCI to trip -- BUT ONLY when any current is being drawn -- but it doesn't matter by what!\\nSo now the question: Is this really how an AFCI will trip or how an arc will happen?   Only when there is any current being drawn?    I was assuming that if the wiring is really susceptible to arcing, it would happen just from hot being poorly insulated from ground or neutral.   Why does current need to be drawn??   Is this just about how AFCIs work?\\nWhat is the explanation of what is wrong with my wiring and/or how to debug it now?\\n\",\n",

Although it occasionally trips when my older vacuum is in use, it does not trip when my neighbor's new vacuum is plugged into the bedroom circuit.  The device trips when it senses a potentially dangerous (although not dangerous) arc in my older vacuum, but also is able to distinguish the arc caused by by my neighbor's vacuum as from a motor and not dangerous.

Some characteristics of the branch circuit and receptacle:\\nSo far, I've pinned it down to tripping only when my living room/dining room ceiling fans are running (lights on or off), kitchen light on, and the outdoor light is on.  All four were replaced by me when I bought the house, and I've already re-wired the kitchen light, since several trips happened when it was on.  I'll add, the kitchen light is a traditional fluorescent, and uses two T32 4ft bulbs, consuming 64W of power.  The ceiling fans use two CFL bulbs, 13W each, and the outdoor light is also CFL.\\nI figure it's gotta be a shoddy wiring job I did on one of them, and my next target to re-wire is the outside light, since that and the living room ceiling fan were the first things I wired in (and my wiring skills have gotten better since then).\\nWhat I am curious about is if there are any better ways to troubleshoot nuisance tripping on AFCI breakers/receptacles.  I know the receptacle is a fairly new thing, so it might be quirky a bit, but I am not sure.  Or should I just re-wire one device at a time and continue to observe if the problems keeps occurring?\\nI have read that fluorescent lights (like my kitchen light) can sometimes trip an AFCI breaker.  Don't know how different or more/less sensitive a receptacle version might be.  Is there a way to guard against a fluoescent fixture tripping an AFCI?\\n\",\n",

After replacing the bad breaker (test button never worked), this means that only my bedrooms have AFCI protection via two breakers.  I began to look at my living room setup and discovered that it's on a two-pole breaker (15A), with the second pole shared by the main hallway and bathroom lighting circuit, w/ both branch circuits sharing the neutral wire.\\nSome more digging turns up that Square D (now owned by Schneider-Electric) does not make a two-pole AFCI breaker for QO panels, citing limited demand for two-pole AFCI for shared neutral circuits (pg 6)†.  So I looked up an AFCI receptacle, which are pretty new overall, and found the AFTR1-W by Leviton.  If I were to get and install such a receptacle as the first living room receptacle downstream of the living room breaker, will that provide AFCI protection for all downstream receptacles?  And will the neutral wire going through the the living room circuit cause the AFCI receptacle to trip if I flipped on the hallway or bathroom lights?\\nIf so, that will cover about 98% of my living room outlets.  Oddly enough, it appears that the builders pigtailed somewhere after the living room breaker, but before the first receptacle, and used that pigtail to power a GFCI receptacle by my front door that grants GFCI protection to the receptacle outside on the front of the house.  I can test this, because if I plug a GFCI tester into the first downstream socket, I can't trip the nearby GFCI receptacle, so they have to be in parallel somehow.\\nI don't think that if I put the AFCI receptacle in that I'll be able to cover that GFCI receptacle as well, unless I find the pigtail in the wall and wire it to be on the load side of the AFCI receptacle somehow.  But that's only assuming the shared neutral doesn't prohibit me from even using the AFCI receptacle.  Also doesn't look like they make a combination AFCI and GFCI receptacle device, either.\\n† Also, Schneider-Electric has this to say about shared neutrals in residential wiring, too.\\n\",\n",

Occasionally, when I turn on a bank of dimmable CFL lights via a CFL-rated dimmer switch, I get a trip in a particular AFCI breaker that's on the other phase.  This doesn't happen every time, and it seems to happen more when the dimmer isn't set to full brightness.  Resetting the breaker gets the power back on with no issues, but I'm tired of this.\\nI'm at a loss as to why a different circuit on a different phase is tripping, and even more confused why it happens only some of the time.  These are not MWBCs, but obviously share the neutral in the panel feeder.  Nothing else causes any other trips anywhere else in the house that aren't obvious, like 4 hair driers on a 15A circuit.\\nWhat's going on here?  How can I find the cause of this?\\n\",\n",

I know very little about AFCI breakers, however I think I was somehow able to trip it when absolutely no power was on the line I was working with.\\nBoth switches were off, for Black and Red.  They tested dead.  Just because I am a careful guy I tested neutral and ground for voltage as well and they were dead.  I also tested continuity between ground and neutral and infinite resistance between neutral and colored wires as well as ground and colored wires.  Everything is safe.\\nI was fishing the Black, Red, White and Neutral wires through the bracket when they all seemed to have made contact with the bracket at the same time.  Immediately after this happened the lights went dead in the bedroom.  The bedroom and smoke detectors were the only things on this circuit and their was only three lights on at the time.\\nI went to the breaker box to see the AFCI breaker in the middle tripped position, I turned it off, then back on and the ARC FAULT light as well as the GRND light came on.  The breaker stayed on and it never happened again.\\nDoes the AFCI breaker somehow test for a bad ground?  Do you think somehow I triggered a bad ground fault when I accidentally touched all the wires to the bracket?\\nEDIT: So an AFCI breaker does have a neutral to the neutral block, and I imagine so that it can detect ground faults.  Is it possible that the AFCI ground fault protection is so sensitive that I had a static shock that triggered it?  I did get static shocked on my way into the bedroom earlier that morning.  Static discharges from your body typically are only a few milliamps, is that enough to trip an AFCI breaker?\\n',\n",

We have a basement office that we wired ourselves. Code required that we put in an AFCI breaker. From what I've read these can be pretty temperamental and that has been the case with us. The breaker will trip as often as once a day but it is usually less often. We replaced the original AFCI breaker and for about a month after we were good. However, now it has started tripping often again.\\nI have a surge protector hooked up on one outlet with a PC and monitor attached. It is the kind of surge protector with the master outlet that can control the other devices so they turn on/off when the master device turns on/off. I've noticed that anytime we run the garbage disposal upstairs and also at many random times throughout the day, the surge protector will make a clicking sound, like the power has come on/gone off of the main device (the PC). The PC isn't turned on.\\nAny ideas what might be going on here, both with the breaker flipping and/or the surge protector clicking? I know we have mixed wiring of 15A (14 gauge, white) and 20A (12 gauge, yellow). The AFCI breaker itself is 15A. Could either of those be a possible problem or does it sound like this is something else? Bad outlet(s) along the circuit?\\n\",\n",

The second-hand smoke from the upstairs neighbors seeps into the apartment 16 hours a day through gaps around the shoddily installed ceiling fixtures and the poorly weather-stripped doors. The management will do nothing, and there isn\\'t anyplace to move at this price in this pandemic. They basically say, \"Love it or leave it.\" I also have heavy VOC fumes coming from the recently painted cabinets, but that\\'s a side story for now.\\nAs a quick stop-gap measure, I used packing tape to seal the gaps around ceiling fixtures and the poorly weather-stripped doors. I am also airing out the place when I know they are sleeping early in the morning and am boiling water to create positive pressure. That\\'s greatly improved the situation, but it\\'s not sustainable as it\\'s hot, allows the fumes from off-gassing high VOC paint to accumulate, is causing the paint from the doorjambs to come off when tape is removed to open the doors, and is not a complete solution as some cigarette smoke and fumes still get through if we are not actively boiling water. It\\'s too hot for comfort and might be bad for electronics.\\nI\\'m looking at things like this: https://airinnovations.com/negative-positive-pressure-rooms-hospital-infection-control/\\nIn a pandemic when older people are more vulnerable, second-hand smoke doubles the risk of serious complications, few affordable rentals can be found in our rural area, and there\\'s no place to go to get relief, with the libraries closed and so on, I\\'m looking for cheap, fast, easy solutions to improve my temporary measures while I attempt to get help with this situation with enforcement measures or other appropriate means. By the way, I discovered that many older people in such complexes are exposed to heavy second-hand smoke and feel they are powerless to do anything to protect themselves. This is a major health issue and has likely contributed to many deaths in this pandemic. I\\'m not taking this passively. I\\'ll get the situation resolved. But, I\\'m looking for creative solutions to make it more livable fast so I can have the health I need to restart the formerly successful teaching business I largely shut down last year to take a break to work on my health.\\nSomeone marked me down for not having enough research. Now, you have a link. I\\'m looking for creative ideas to stay alive. This situation could sink me as it\\'s a major cancer risk, and I\\'m getting borderline tests back for a recurrence of former cancer. So, please give me a hand with some creative ideas. Do what you\\'d want someone else to do for your mom.\\nIf I didn\\'t think I could somehow get out of here, I\\'d be sinking everything I have into making this place safe. But, I don\\'t feel this place can be made safe. I just need to be safe in the short term while I work on solutions.\\nThanks to those who are willing to help with ideas.\\n',\n",

Part of this section also has a column (a bunch of 2x4s) that supports an LVL beam, so routing ducts there is likely out of the question.\\nInitially, I was only aware of one return air vent in joist space labeled #1, but once I opened the wall, I saw that the subfloor is actually has a cut-out below both, #1 and #2 stud spaces to split the return-air route. While #1 is taking the air from this space, the #2 route is fed by at least two return grills on the second level of the house. The air intake under the subfloor is an actual duct, maybe 6-8\" diameter running from the basement and it is \"cracked open\" at the joist below to suck in air from two stud spaces.\\nSo, my question is, what is the best way to tackle this and remove the stud spaces #1 and #2? I thought of the following options:\\nRip subfloors (tile is going away anyway, so not a huge deal), along this wall to see how far that duct goes and then add a single stud-space to the furthest wall, where I will route both #1 (opening in the wall for the first floor), and #2 (opening in the joist space in the ceiling to get back to the other returns). Once I remove that 2x4 that is supporting that \"header\" with short 2x4s hanging down, I should be able to see how far that joist space opening goes to feed the upstairs and route accordingly.\\nAdd to the thickness of the #0 stud space, basically, add another wall (shown with purple line) right behind that supporting column, delete that electrical outlet (I\\'ll see if I can terminate it properly in the outlet on the other side, or even somehow bring it out in the new wall in it\\'s own tiny stud space.), then split that additional column into two smaller joist spaces and route the return air that way.\\nWhat does everyone think? Any other ideas/options? Any concerns about the above options?\\nThanks so much! David\\n\\n',\n",

It's really unfortunate but luckily it was still on the pallet so when it fell it fell flat to where the only parts damaged were the electric motor fan cover and the pump filter housing and tank. The tank took the brunt of the fall on concrete. We got it stood back up and now the tank has a light flat spot where the cylinder is welded to the end cap. It's definitely dented now at the weld near the top of the tank. My question is is it ok to have a dent like that or should I trash the entire tank and buy a new one? I spent a bunch of money on this darn thing. We definitely underestimated the weight of this thing. Are dented air tanks safe to use?

It will require a 220-240v circuit. Currently, there is no existing circuit in my garage that can power the air compressor. In addition, there is only one remaining breaker space in my load center. The garage is located on the first floor at the front of my home, while the load center is located on the exterior of the house, on the side wall, toward the rear of my home. There is perhaps a distance of 40 feet (rough approximation) between the load center and the location where I want to install the air compressor in the garage.\\nConsidering all these, what would be the best plan of action for wiring the stationary air compressor inside the garage? This is a two-story home with attic space where it is difficult to manuever toward the sides of the home. In other words, as I move away from the center of the attic, I would have to worry about getting my head pierced by roofing nails (if I were not wise enough to wear a hard hat, of course)! There is no basement.\\nThe make and model of the load center is Siemens W2424L1125CU. It has 24 spaces and a 125-amp main breaker.\\n\\n\",\n",

The two A/C's running at the same time is definitely and unambiguously at fault.

I'd prefer to stick something between the A/C's and the wall (because there are only two of them) than have to put lots of filters/conditioners on everything else.\\nMy Google-Fu has failed me - I can only seem to find information on how to protect sensitive devices from EMI/voltage fluctuations (e.g. stick a online UPS between a computer and the wall), and not how to properly mitigate a known dirty device.\\nI'm in the US with 120VAC single phase power.\\nWhat is the proper device to add inline to an air conditioner or other motor-driven device in order to keep the rest of the power clean? Isolation transformer? Line conditioner? UPS (if so, what flavor - battery backup in an outage doesn't matter except as a means to smooth the inrush voltage fluctuations)? Massive ferrite bead?\\nEdit:\\nI have read several proscriptions against using a UPS or AVR, etc on electric motors, primarily because the startup current draw of the motor might exceed the capabilities of the device. (See almost every post on laser printers for reference) Most advice seems to treat this as a blanket prohibition, but in reality there is obviously more nuance to it: https://www.apc.com/us/en/faqs/FA158851/ So to refine the question somewhat - assuming the inline device is properly sized for the motor and providing a natural sinewave, as noted in the APC link above, what is the proper device to use to isolate/smooth a motor driven appliance from its 120V AC power supply?\\n\",\n",

It was working completely fine until I changed the filter on the HVAC unit. The HVAC is relatively new and was installed August 2019. Had a contractor come and take a look and he checked every component of the HVAC unit and said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the HVAC unit. He said that there is something wrong with my smart thermostat (Ecobee 3). He said that sometimes smart thermostats randomly turn off the system and that likely it will randomly come back on. He said to wait until Monday morning and see if it starts to work. Until then he is letting the HVAC unit run without a filter. He said if it starts to work then I can go ahead and put the filter back in. Does it make sense that my Ecobee 3 randomly is stopping my HVAC from blowing cool air? If so, is there anything I can do to troubleshoot the thermostat to get it to blow cool air again before monday morning? Thanks in advance for any help.

Suggested methods would probably disturb soil and might add to water infiltration to basement.\\n2. Plastic pad\\nPros: Cheap, light, easy install, seems to be favored by contractors\\nCons: Not sure how durable these are - seems like it would be hard to replace if expected life is 10-15 years and it goes before we next intend to replace the AC units (which might be another 30 years). Also, may still tilt/sink if the soil below it moves and it\\'s not clear how we\\'d fix the tilt.\\n3. Mount on wall of house\\nPros: Should eliminate the possibility of tilting/moving\\nCons: Not sure if allowed by code in Northern Illinois; Might be noisier since connected to house (but maybe there\\'s a way to prevent noise transmission?); Not sure where to find materials to do or if contractors will be willing/competent to do it.\\n',\n",

With the thermostat set to 72 degrees, I imagine the bedroom is probably 68 degrees, and the office is warmer than 76 degrees. The thermostat is in the hallway between these two rooms.\\nI think the issue is this: The bedroom has a larger duct supplying a single 10x10 vent immediately after the air handler and the office has a smaller duct supplying a single 6x8 vent at the end of the line. So the pressure difference at the two vents is dramatic. It creates two issues:\\nToday it's 100 degrees outside, and so I closed the vent to the bedroom 3/4 of the way. This seems to balance the air load well enough (this is the first time my wife has ever complained about being cold in that room), but I'll have to re-adjust it tonight since it will be impossible to sleep with the noise.\\nI'm wondering, is there a relatively easy way to adjust the airflow into our bedroom so that 1) It's not too loud, and 2) airflow is restricted enough to leave sufficient pressure for the office?\\n\",\n",

Has been sitting in the garage unused for a couple of years. Gave it to my son to use and after a couple hours of running he reported there was a large puddle of water under it but the collection bin for the water (that needs to be manually emptied and sounds an alarm when it needs emptying ) was bone dry.\\nI tried 2 tests. First one i ran in the garage for a couple of hours. No leak...but also no water in the collection container. When preparing to bring it inside for test 2, I tipped it and water ran out, confirming that water was going somewhere....just not to the collection bin. I brought it inside and put a pan under the unit to catch any leaking water and ran it for a couple of hours. When i checked I found a puddle under the unit, no water in the tray I put under it, and the unit's collection bucket was bone dry. When i was taking the unit back out to the garage and tipped it to get it down some stairs, the collected water came out.\\nAny idea how i can locate the leak? Do these things operate if I pull the back off and try to run it for a couple hours? It's as if there is a hose inside the unit that is supposed to direct the condensate to the collection container but it has dislodged. Is that a possibility?  thanks.\\nMore info + pics:\\n\\nSee info on top pic. It makes sense if the secondary drain hose has a plug with a small hole in it, water will come out. I tested this.But what is puzzling is this thing has never been opened up. This is all original equipment. And it has never  leaked before. The other odd thing is when i poured water into the condensate tray, it drained to the secondary hose first. I covered the hole in the secondary hose plug, and water eventually started flowing, as expected, into the condensate container. I figure the secondary hose just filled up, backed into the condensate reservoir, and found the drain hole into the condensate container.\\nSo do I just plug the hole in the secondary hose's plug? At least that seems like a place to start I suppose.\\nIt is just so odd as there are no issues or rotting hoses, yet this leaking has never occurred before. And why is there a hole in the plug on the secondary container if it isn't supposed to be there?\\nthanks.\\n\",\n",

Two weeks ago, the unit stopped cooling. A/C company couldn't come out until the next day and the house got pretty miserable. When the tech arrived early the next day he measured temps in the return plenum at 78, and supply plenum at 76. Obviously air was not being cooled. His diagnosis was that the evaporator coil was broken and needed to be replaced and that we should probably replace the whole system as well given the age.\\nThen we went outside to the condenser and he measured the R-22 levels. The readings were 58/196 (those numbers mean nothing to me, but he said it was pretty low) and the temperature in the system was 33 degrees, instead of 40 like it should be. He hooked everything back up and gave us quotes for $7200-$8600 to get a whole new system.\\nHowever, after hooking everything back up, the A/C began cooling just like it had before. My suspicion is that the line was either frozen (given the very close to freezing temperatures) or something else was preventing freon from moving through the system, and his measuring the levels caused it to start working again.\\nWe obviously have an R-22 system, and the cost of adding R-22 is very expensive now, but it seems the rest of the system is still working fine (I just replaced a blower motor myself 2-3 months ago). I'd hate to dump $7k in a system that might have a year or more left in it before something really goes wrong. Would adding additional R-22 cause the temperature in the freon line to increase, and potentially prevent this from happening again for the short term? Would it be better to bite the bullet and just replace everything now?\\nEdit: After listening to the advice here, I added 2lbs of R-22 to the system. Unfortunately, everything stopped working again 8 days later and we couldn't get it to start cooling again after 36hours of turning it off and back on. We had to go ahead and replace the whole system. My assumption is that we had two problems: the R-22 was low, and the evaporator coil had gone bad and the initial problem was that the coil just hadn't completely died when the first service call happened.\\n\",\n",

The old one didn't have a C-wire but luckily there is an unused wire on both sides (one coming out of the wall and one at the furnace not connected yet), so I am going to use this unused wire as the C-wire. My only concern is that the C terminal at the furnace is already occupied with other two wires (that have nothing to do with the thermostat, but are connected one to the humidifier and the other one not sure to what, probably the air purifier). The question is: can I add a third wire to the C board of the furnace and use it as C-wire for the wi-fi thermostat? See picture: yellow is the unused wire.\\n\",\n",

When the scenario with the smell is happening in the bathroom, if I go outside my house into that part of the front of the house, I can also smell the bad odor, but not as strongly as in the bathroom.\\nI once had a plumber here to see if I could create the smell. It was about 9am and I turned on the A/C for about 20 minutes then turned on the kitchen faucet, and OF COURSE it didn't smell, so he couldn't help pinpoint the situation. I guess a prerequisite is that the A/C be on for hours or all day.\\nIn conclusion, the smell doesn't come in any other scenario. It's just the combination of the A/C and kitchen sink (no other sink in the house causes it). And the smell is only that bathroom. I have another bathroom and no problem there. I've had the HVAC unit for 3 years and it's really been happening for a year now.\\nAsk me any questions you may have and thank you in advance for reading this long story and for any input you may have.\\n\",\n",
